How to achieve health goals like a genius?\\n\\nBuy Ayuga's 100% Kumkumadi Skin Radiance Face Oil - https://bit.ly/3DQfpvs\\n(Apply Code FITTUBER15 to get 15% off)\\nBuy from Amazon - https://amzn.to/3GzZC3H\\n\\nIn this video, I am going to share with you 5 Healthy habits of a genius that are very easy to implement and yet have a huge positive impact on health. A genius is the one who focuses on low hanging fruits, who not just achieve his fitness goals without compromising on taste or health but also saves money in the process. So without any further delay, let’s get started.\\n\\n00:57 - #5 Healthy habit of a Genius - A genius will make use of the Sunlight - The miracles of sunlight have now been proven beyond doubt. An ordinary man even after knowing the fantastic benefits of the sun will fail to make use of nature’s this free gift. But a genius will not just utilise it but will also save his time and effort.\\n02:27 - #4 Healthy habit of a Genius - A genius will eat local and seasonal - Food no matter how nutritious it looks on paper if it doesn’t get absorbed by the body, it’s not worth it. Is it? An ordinary person will fail to realise this.\\n03:58 - #3 Healthy habit of a Genius - A genius will make home food interesting - Only an ordinary person will keep his home food boring.

During the research of this video, even I was surprised to find some facts that I have shared with you in this video.\\n\\n01:30 - COLLAGEN - Collagen is an amino acid mainly responsible for skin strength and elasticity. The collagen trend has spread from cosmetic injections to products you see everywhere. But before you spend your money on them, first consider if your body really needs it.\\n03:33 - FISH OIL - To spend a day without consuming fish oil capsules is a crime, that’s how the supplement industry projects it. However, the question is that can we fulfil the daily need for omega 3s through vegetarian food?\\n04:57 - BIOTIN - Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that’s a part of the vitamin B family. Since it plays a crucial role in the health of your hair it has been named Vitamin H. What are the best sources of biotin?\\n06:42 - VITAMIN B12 - If you are a vegetarian, you have to take a vitamin b12 supplement. This has almost become the slogan of the supplement industry. Not many know that there are some amazing vegetarian vitamin B12 foods around us.\\n07:58 - CALCIUM - Young and the old alike extensively consume calcium tablets hoping to strengthen their bones. However, little do they know that these calcium tablets can do more damage than good.\\n10:01 - ZINC - Zinc, even though a trace mineral, is extremely important for a robust immune system and production of testosterone in males. But one need not take refuge in pills anyway.\\n11:05 - VITAMIN C - Do you have weak bleeding gums? Or do you often suffer from mouth ulcers? If yes, then your body is screaming from vitamin c and not vitamin c pills. Nature has indeed provided abundant sources of vitamin c to us that if we still have to pop pills, it's a shame.\\n\\nFOODS & PRODUCTS RELATED TO THE VIDEO (Not Sponsored)📦\\nCold Pressed Sesame oil (to massage for collagen production) - https://amzn.to/3mmkG78\\nCopper Jug (to charge water for collagen production) - https://amzn.to/2W3BHId\\nCopper bottle (to charge water for collagen production) - https://amzn.to/2WbO19u\\nFlaxseeds (for omega 3s) - https://amzn.to/2W59n8m\\nWalnuts (for omega 3s) - https://amzn.to/3z8OmZ2\\nWheatgrass powder (for Vitamin B12) - https://amzn.to/3mjGTD2\\nMoringa Powder (for Vitamin B12) - https://amzn.to/2XIDp2D\\nAmalki Rasayan (for Vitamin B12 and Vitamin C) - https://amzn.to/3mi6qfD\\nPhool Makhana (for calcium) - https://amzn.to/3818znz\\nPeanut Butter (for calcium) - https://amzn.to/3D1wlOK\\nEdible choona (for calcium) - https://amzn.to/3AZMDGa\\nEdible Choona (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mgdY2D\\nDesi A2 Cow Ghee (for vitamin D and absorption of fat soluble vitamins) - https://amzn.to/2W7WBpS\\nDesi A2 Coe Ghee (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mk3GhJ\\nUnsweetened Cocoa Powder (for Zinc) - https://amzn.to/37Y8gKf\\nCashews (for Zinc) - https://amzn.to/2UwCP6G\\n\\n✅  SUPPORT MY WORK and get exclusive perks \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw/join\\n\\nINSTAGRAM :  Follow me on Instagram\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fittuber\\n\\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS 📹\\n28 Signs Your Body is Deficient in Vital Nutrients (With Solution)\\nhttps://youtu.be/JZlXdba7ALI\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM UPDATED WORST TO BEST 2020 SERIES (Not Sponsored)\\nShampoo (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2IdTmor\\nShampoo (option 2)- https://amzn.to/2U7ZhwV\\nShampoo (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3h1mDB6\\nFace wash (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2J6vLW6\\nFace wash (option 2) - https://amzn.to/2J5JRH6\\nFace wash (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2J5QKs7\\nHair oil (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2YU6zqh\\nHair oil (option 2) - https://amzn.to/33uYhZI\\nHair oil (option 3) - https://amzn.to/33tj938\\nMoisturiser (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3n4cdCL\\nMoisturiser (option 2) - https://amzn.to/38r46fE\\nMoisturiser (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2U7Y0Z4\\nCooking oil (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2K85ha5\\nCooking oil (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mqWUnY\\nCooking oil (option 3)  - https://amzn.to/35AVSQw\\nBiscuits (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3p5XxEm\\nNamkeen (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3riSnXs\\n\\n12:59 - Segment Partner - Mamaearth Rash Cream for Babies\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Whatever I have spoken in this video is my honest opinion.

Have you wondered why?\\n03:42 - A south Indian will never miss out on adding fenugreek seeds while preparing the batter. Do you know the reason behind this?\\n04:28 - Using bare hands while preparing food is intrinsic to Indian cooking.But isn’t it dirty and unhygienic? \\n05:15 - You must have heard that vegetarian food is an incomplete source of protein. Thanks to our ancestors, it does not apply to Indian vegetarians who do this.\\n05:59 - Ask your grandmother what probiotics are? Well, she might not be aware of the term. However, she knew how to take them through food and that too much more effectively.\\n06:47 - The rich soil of India produces countless varieties of lentils but have you wondered why only moong dal is used in khichdi? \\n07:31 - Why Indians put tadka in the curry?\\n09:08 - Dishonourable Mentions\\n09:26 - Cast iron Kadhai has always been cherished as a prized possession by Indian mothers who cook .

Even though these products are always in front of us, they remain unnoticed but during the research of the video, I was shocked to know that they pose some serious health hazards. It’s high time we talk about them as I can assure that most of you would be using at least 3 out of these 5 products almost daily. We will discuss why they are so damaging and how you can switch to healthier and economical alternatives that too are easily available.\\n\\n00:54 - #5 Detergent - If you often suffer from skin problems, you should be extremely cautious of what detergent you are using to wash your clothes as most commercial ones have phosphates, dyes and bleaches that are severely skin irritating.\\n02:35 - #4 Fruit & Vegetable Wash - With the rampant use of pesticides on fruits and vegetables these days, a washer seems like the need of an hour.\\n03:39 - #3 Surface Cleaner - Colin and Mr Muscle are two products extensively used.

Anti ageing is one of those buzz words which gets tossed around very casually across various product lines. Many companies want you to believe that by applying one particular cream or lotion you can slow down the ageing process but it's far from the truth.While you can't really stop the process, you can certainly delay the signs of ageing by following these 5 ways which have been mentioned in Ayurvedic texts and are now validated  by modern science as well.  \\n\\n00:43 - #5 Anti Ageing Way to age slowly - Just take out 1 minute from your busy schedule, sit back and count the number of breaths that you take in 1 minute. Ancient saints and sages discovered a deep and profound relationship between our breathing pattern and the quality and longevity of life.\\n02:47 - #4 Anti Ageing Way to age slowly - The word Ayurveda means the science of life. It is not just about food and herbs but also presses on the importance of selfless service in increasing longevity and health span of an individual.\\n04:11 - #3 Anti Ageing Way to age slowly - The concept of anti-ageing is described in Ayurveda as RASAYANA chikitsa. Ayurveda has identified various herbs that have demonstrated their effect of oxygen radical absorbance and thereby reversing premature ageing.\\n05:30 - #2 Anti Ageing Way to age slowly - This one has always been considered the best anti ageing pill by Ayurveda and today modern science is in tune with it. \\n07:03 - #1 Anti Ageing Way to age slowly -  This is probably not so easy but highly rewarding.

A primer, foundation, lipstick, kajal, mascara, eye liner, blusher and so on. But do you know what goes in making your favourite makeup products? Loads of harsh chemicals to say the least. Using such products on a regular basis prematurely ages the skin and causes myriad skin issues. But don’t worry. It is time to throw these toxic products away as I share with you the natural makeup products available in the Indian market. \\n\\n00:58 - #7 Natural Make up Product - Foundation - Foundation is a liquid or powder makeup applied to the face to create an even, uniform color to the complexion and enhance the natural skin tone.\\n02:00 - #6 Natural Make up Product - Primer - Any make up generally starts with a primer. And rightly so, a primer smoothens the pores of the skin and creates an even layer on top of it for foundation to glide onto. So a good primer creates a solid base for makeup. \\n03:11 - #5 Natural Make up Product - Mascara - A few swipes of a mascara wand are generally used to give an instant awakened look naturally, even on those worst mornings.  But wait a minute? Did I say naturally? Well, the harsh truth is that commercial mascara is nowhere close to natural. \\n04:23 - #4 Natural Make up Product - Blusher - Cheek tints give that final edge to a well finished look offering a lustrous healthy glow to the cheeks. \\n05:18 - #3 Natural Make up Product - Kajal - Applying natural kajal to newborns and women is practiced in India since ages. Wearing kajal not just adds beauty to the eyes but also protects them from diseases.\\n06:47 - #2 Natural Make up Product - Eyeliner - Eyeliner is another product that finds a place in a woman’s makeup kit. Its primary purpose is to make the eye lashes look lush.\\n07:31 - #1 Natural Make up Product - Lipstick - Lipstick is something women wear daily all day long - sometimes even to bed. Many lipsticks contain heavy metals in their contaminated form.\\n\\nPRODUCTS RELATED TO THE VIDEO (Not Sponsored)📦\\nRuby Organics Foundation - https://amzn.to/3hjuESs\\nJust Herbs Foundation cum BB Cream - https://amzn.to/3hh7VWO\\nCold Pressed Olive oil as primer - https://amzn.to/37KUuvm\\nCold Pressed Argan Oil as Primer - https://amzn.to/38AvuWF\\nCold Pressed Sesame oil as Primer - https://amzn.to/3nJgV9L\\nPure Aloe vera gel (Primer for oily skin) - https://amzn.to/3hfG7Ce\\nSoultree Mascara (Black) - https://amzn.to/2KWYHmt\\nSoultree Mascara (Brown) - https://amzn.to/3hfPQbG\\nSpoolie Brush - https://amzn.to/37OISaC\\nDaughter Earth Cheek & Lip Tints - https://amzn.to/34KXgi6\\nBloom Baths Cheek & Lip tints - https://www.bloombaths.com/search-results/q-tints/qc-all\\nSoultree Kajal - https://amzn.to/34HAMPb\\nSantulan Kajal - https://amzn.to/3hfsF1p\\nRuby's Organics Eyeliner - https://amzn.to/2WJzlLD\\nRuby's Organics Lipstick - https://amzn.to/3poP67a\\nJust herbs Lipstick - https://amzn.to/3aFtjE7\\nSoultree Lipstick - https://amzn.to/3pn59lJ\\n\\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS 📹\\n5 Natural Face Moisturisers under Rs 299 (Not Sponsored) - Checkout for Primers\\nhttps://youtu.be/kqD1X1q6suM\\n\\n✅  SUPPORT MY WORK and get exclusive perks \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw/join\\n\\nINSTAGRAM :  https://www.instagram.com/fittuber\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM UPDATE WORST TO BEST 2020 SERIES (Not Sponsored)📦\\nShampoo (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2IdTmor\\nShampoo (option 2)- https://amzn.to/2U7ZhwV\\nShampoo (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3h1mDB6\\nBathing Soap (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3rgaTzN\\nBathing Soap (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3jMd2y0\\nToothpaste (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3jrcNbu\\nToothpaste (option 2) - https://amzn.to/35C4GDZ\\nFace wash (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2J6vLW6\\nFace wash (option 2) - https://amzn.to/2J5JRH6\\nFace wash (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2J5QKs7\\nHair oil (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2YU6zqh\\nHair oil (option 2) - https://amzn.to/33uYhZI\\nMoisturiser (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3n4cdCL\\nMoisturiser (option 2) - https://amzn.to/38r46fE\\nGhee (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3eplzUS\\nGhee (option 2) - https://amzn.to/38cDTzG\\nHair Conditioner (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3oQ0o3S\\nHair colour (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2KSyDbu\\n\\n08:57 - Segment Partner - Mamaearth Vitamin C Face wash and Face mask\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Whatever I have spoken in this video is my honest opinion.

For this video, I went through various classical ayurvedic scriptures and also consulted Ayurvedic practitioners and even modern medical doctors to bring across the most authentic information to you. While selecting the Ayurvedic pills, my main criteria has been how common  the issue is faced in day to day life, how straightforward it’s Ayurvedic solution is and of course the medicine should be safe for all body types. \\n\\n00:39 - When are down with sore throat, cold or cough, we often look for instant relief with vicks, strepsils or cofsil tablets. Next time try the natural Ayurvedic Alternative.\\n01:20 - Stomach ache issues? Do you often face bloating in the stomach due to gas? Here is an effective Ayurvedic tablet to try.\\n02:09 - Do you suffer from diarrhoea time and often? Do keep this safe and natural ayurvedic churan/tablet handy with you.\\n02:54 - Suffering from fever? Instead of using the regular crocin or paracetamol tablets, try this classical ayurvedic tablet.\\n03:37 - Headaches have become quite normal. Instead of saridon, try this Ayurvedic tablet which is especially formulated to get rid of headaches.\\n04:34 - Do you suffer from constipation? Here are a few very effective ayurvedic tablets and oils for faster results.\\n05:24 - Do you suffer from excessive sneezing, headache or often cold and cough due to sinus problem? This Ayurvedic tablet is what you should opt for.\\n06:15 - Do you suffer from acidity? Instead of the regular gelusil antacid, try Ayurveda's this classical herbal mineral medicine.\\n07:11 - When you suffer from blocked nose, cold or congestion in the chest area, instead of using the usual vicks vaporub, try this Ayurvedic oil like concoction.\\n08:11 - If you often suffer from body pains, nerve pains or muscle pain, you should have this Ayurvedic tablet handy with you.\\n\\nAYURVEDIC TABLETS AS SUGGESTED IN THE VIDEO (Not Sponsored)📦\\nKanth Sudharak Vati (replacement for vicks, strepsils) - https://amzn.to/39JaUpf\\nKanth Sudharak Vati (option2) - https://amzn.to/36FtYTv\\nKanth Sudharak Vati (option3) - https://amzn.to/33KHmnC\\nGandhak Raj Bati (for stomach pain, bloating etc.) -https://amzn.to/33Gypf1\\nGandhak Raj Bati (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3gcygVs\\nGandhak Raj Bati (option 3) - https://amzn.to/39IVXDL\\nBilwadi Churan (for diarrhoea) - https://amzn.to/2JTYG28\\nBilwadi Churan (option 2) - https://amzn.to/36IZXSJ\\nBiwaldi Churan (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3mIxVfK\\nBilwadi vati (for diarrhoea in tablet form) - https://amzn.to/3oCU5AT\\nBilwadi vati (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mLD7PU\\nMahasudarshan Ghanvati (for fever) - https://amzn.to/3gaZ20F\\nMahasudarshan Ghanvati (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mEGLLz\\nMahasudarshan Ghanvati (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2VGmvgM\\nShirshuladi vati (for headache) - https://amzn.to/2VELBfX\\nShirshuladi vati (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mJaMtz\\nShirshuladi vati (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3gedTYa\\nTriphala Guggul (for constipation) - https://amzn.to/3mLeHpN\\nTriphala Guggul (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3lNRQZj\\nCastor oil (for constipation) - https://amzn.to/3mJznyH\\nCastor oil (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mJaV05\\nLaxmi Vilas Ras (for cold, cough, sinus problems) - https://amzn.to/3otYCWb\\nLaxmi Vilas Ras (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3g9zxNe\\nLaxmi Vilas Ras (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2Id6zzl\\nKamdhudha Ras (for acidity, piles, bleeding) - https://amzn.to/3lLkaLU\\nAmritdhara (for blocked nose, congestion in chest ) - https://amzn.to/36GtJrg\\nDivyadhara (patanjali version of amritdhara) - https://amzn.to/2VSzyfj\\nVatganjankush Ras (for body pains) - https://amzn.to/2IhGEGU\\nVatgajankush Ras (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3lJzmcC\\nVatgajankush Ras (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3lK9wVG\\n\\n✅  SUPPORT MY WORK and get exclusive perks \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw/join\\n\\nINSTAGRAM :  Follow and participate in Q&A sessions, weekly topic polls\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fittuber\\n\\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS 📹\\nUltimate Ayurvedic Body Test in 5 Mins (Vata Pitta Kapha Explained)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVsFfFeYNs\\n\\nULTIMATE Ayurvedic Routine to Cure Cold & Cough Problems\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6oCNc6_-uQ&t=338s&ab_channel=FitTuber\\n\\n09:31 - Video Partner - Mamaearth's Toxin Free Onion Hair oil\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Whatever I have spoken in this video is my honest opinion.

Well, to get an answer I did examine many of our ancient Ayurvedic scriptures and have also had conversations with multiple top notch modern medical doctors to understand both the perspectives. While modern medical experts offer no solution other than human growth hormone injections on the other hand Ayurveda has a set of simple practices through which 100s and 1000s  have already grown taller. Where modern science broadly suggests healthy diet and daily exercise, Ayurveda on the other hand goes much deeper to identify certain foods and herbs in nature that directly impact the height. It may be a hard pill to swallow for many modern doctors but Ayurveda clearly states that irrespective of your genetics, if you are under 21 years of age, all you need is a few simple ingredients, conviction in your mind and a strong will power to shoot up your height.

From food products to cosmetics to yoga accessories and home decor Isha life has over 500 products. Out of all these products, I have chosen 5 products which in my opinion are genuine, high in utility and value for money.\\n\\n00:45 - Sadhguru's Amazing Isha Life Product #5 -  To make a kid drink plain milk can be quite a task. That is where health drinks come into picture. However, most health drinks in the Indian market are nothing but sugar boxes covered under big celebrity endorsements. Bournvita, milo, complan, horlicks or even Patanjali' powervita, they all are the same. Isha life has something truly healthy to offer.\\n02:03 - Sadhguru's Amazing Isha Life Product #4 - While, it is very easy to claim yourself natural, herbal and all that good stuff but it is extremely difficult to live up to such tall claims. Although,  Isha life have surely gone the toxin free way with this face wash as it has not even a single harsh chemical in it. However, it is to be noted that not all face washes made by isha life are toxin free. \\n02:56 - Sadhguru's Amazing Isha Life Product #3 - If you are a dosa lover like me, this product is really worth your money and health. Also, Isha life was managed to provide the product at a cheaper price than what it's arch rival has to offer. Not to forget the colossal difference in the quality of the ingredients.\\n03:57 - Sadhguru's Amazing Isha Life Product #2 - Not one but a pack of 5 products which can truly replace almost every product in your bathroom. If you are looking to opt for a healthy body care product line in budget, this combo pack is a great choice.\\n05:04 - Why we should not blindly follow and buy Sadhguru's Isha Life products?\\n05:12 - Dishonourable mentions - This includes some products by Isha life which are substandard.\\n06:18 - Why you should always check the ingredients of the product and not just buy according to which brand has made it.\\n06:32 - Sadhguru's Amazing Isha Life Product #1 - For those times when you feel like drinking something hot without experiencing a sudden a coffee crash, this drink by isha life is a great choice. With the right combination of 4 herbs, it’s effect is invigorating for the body and calming for the mind.\\n\\nFOODS & PRODUCTS RELATED TO THE VIDEO (Not Sponsored)\\nSanjeevini Instant Health Drink - https://www.ishalife.com/in/instant-sanjeevini-500gm\\nIsha life Purely Natural Face wash - https://www.ishalife.com/in/purely-natural-face-cleanser\\nAdai Dosa Mix - https://www.ishalife.com/in/adai-dosa-mix\\nBath Combo - https://www.ishalife.com/in/100-natural-bath-combo-pack\\nSukku Coffee - https://www.ishalife.com/in/sukku-coffee-herbal-drink\\n\\nDisclaimer - This video is not sponsored by Isha Life nor do I have any kind of relation or association with them.

Which company makes the best bread in India?\\n\\nBuy Oziva's Superfood Greens & Herbs - http://bit.ly/35E7XSy\\nProtein & Herbs, Women - http://bit.ly/2OUGTbL\\nProtein & Herbs, Men - http://bit.ly/2nRnNrS\\nBuy Oziva Products from Amazon - https://amzn.to/36o2Ia2\\n\\nWhich bread do you eat? White bread, brown bread, atta bread, whole wheat bread or multigrain bread? Which brand of bread do you prefer? Bonn, britannia, harvest gold, english oven, mother dairy or la americana. Which is the healthiest bread in the Indian market? To find out, I bought almost every bread available online and offline. Thoroughly researched every ingredient written on it and have accordingly categorised them into 4 major categories.\\n\\n00:32 - CATEGORY 1 - These breads have not even in a single ingredient in them which can be called healthy. From 100% maida to refined vegetable oils to preservatives, emulsifiers, improvers, regulators and what not. Unfortunately, all these breads are the most popular among the Indians. \\n01:00 - CATEGORY 2 - All these brands want to selInl their breads to people who are seeking healthy breads but do not want an effort to make them. Well, that’s because they have boastfully labelled themselves as wheat and atta breads but the real story is revealed when you turn the pack. \\n01:45 - CATEGORY 3 - Absolutely free from maida, these commercial breads are surely better than the ones mentioned in the previous two categories. However, most of them do have some additives.\\n02:30 - Why are so many additives added in commercial breads? Is it possible to bake bread without them?\\n03:08 - Harsh additives added in breads that may cost you your health.\\n03:24 - CATEGORY 4 - These are the best breads in the Indian market.\\n04:30 - if you are looking for a bread without any compromise, then just like roti, you have to even bake a bread at home. Yes, it’s actually easy. You will love it.\\n\\nINGREDIENTS USED IN HOMEMADE BREAD\\nWhole wheat flour - https://amzn.to/3l6fj97\\nRock Salt - https://amzn.to/3lcMk3I\\nMishri Powder - https://amzn.to/32gZ14x\\nInstant dry active yeast - https://amzn.to/34kj6K9\\nBread mould ( Please note that this one is 3/4th smaller in size in comparison to the one used in the video.

Seemingly minor problems of our body which we often tend to ignore are the warning signs given by our body that something needs to be fixed internally.

Most popular ghee in India Ranked from Worst to Best. \\nWhich company makes the best ghee in India?\\n\\nBuy Mamaearth Toxin Free Face Scrubs - https://bit.ly/3ddQcMD\\n(Apply discount coupon FITTUBER21 to get 21% OFF)\\nBuy from Amazon (Ubtan face scrub) - https://amzn.to/38QvktW\\nBuy from Amazon (Charcoal face scrub) - https://amzn.to/3gT7Ln4\\n\\nIf there is one food should be a part of everyone diet, it is this golden nectar called ghee. But which ghee do you use? Amul ghee, Patanjali’s cow ghee, Gowardhan, milkfood, Nestle, Aashirwaad or organic India. What did the lab results show when these most popular brands of ghee were tested? Basically, which is the best ghee in the Indian market? To find out, I have researched and broken down all the ghee available in the Indian market into 4 major categories.\\n\\n00:38 -  CATEGORY 1 - I call them the fake ghee. Popularised due to their extremely cheap rates and unethical marketing. These are nothing but partially hydrogenated oils, probably the worst cooking mediums. If you care even a little about your health, stay away from them.\\n 00:59 - CATEGORY 2 - This category includes the ghee which a majority of Indian population consumes. The very first question that arises is about the possible adulteration in these commercial brands. The problem about this ghee lies in two things. Overall, all the ghee packs in this category are far from the best. They aren’t really ghee in true sense.\\n00:28 - CATEGORY 3 - The ghee in this category in this category is definitely better than the ones discussed in the previous categories but is still not the best. Even here, the problem lies with the breed of cows and the method of production of ghee. Moreover, they are charging a premium price for a ghee which is not really premium.\\n03:06 - Honourable mention\\n03:30 - CATEGORY 4 - This category includes the best ghee in the Indian market. This is the authentic ghee as described in our Ayurvedic scriptures. It is the ghee in this category which is known for its miraculous properties. It is this ghee which doesn't let stubborn fat sit on the body. It is this ghee which kills toxins in the body. It is this ghee which has numerous benefits when used both internal and external.\\n\\nBEST GHEE IN THE INDIAN MARKET (Not Sponsored)\\n\\nGIR COW GHEE (A2 Desi cow ghee made with Bilona method)\\nAhinsak Gau Ghee (Rs 5000/L) - https://amzn.to/2WaFmkR\\nThe way we were (Rs 4256/L) - https://amzn.to/38QxidO\\nIsha Vasyam (Rs 3420/L) - https://amzn.to/2OkAO6M\\nAmorearth (Rs 3500/L) - https://amzn.to/3gULJQT\\nGirOrganic (Rs 2398/L) - https://amzn.to/2WbKogH\\nKesariya Farms (Rs 1799/L) - https://amzn.to/327EYHl\\nShree Radhey (Rs 1650/L) - https://amzn.to/3eplzUS\\nDivya Kamdhenu (Rs 1999/L) - https://amzn.to/3en7pDR\\nUmanac (Rs 2700/L) - https://amzn.to/2OgxQAn\\nBhumi Sutra (Rs 2396/L) - https://amzn.to/304GxTZ\\nVanalaya (Rs 2000/L) - https://amzn.to/2ZWWTxQ\\nSwaranamrit (Rs 1700/L) - https://amzn.to/2CpwPDp\\nVagad (Rs 1980/L) - https://amzn.to/3gIFK1I\\nBack2Basics (Rs 4166/L) - https://amzn.to/324pHaq\\n\\nSAHIWAL COW GHEE (A2 Desi cow ghee made with Bilona method)\\nShahji (Rs 1798/L) - https://amzn.to/3iWpiwv\\nYugmantra (Rs 1318/L) - https://amzn.to/302x67j\\nFarm Naturelle (Rs 1398/L) - https://amzn.to/2ZkMhK4\\nCowGold (Rs 1045/L) (Sahiwal and rathi cow ghee) - https://amzn.to/2C5vNwD\\n\\nKANKREJ COW GHEE (A2 Desi cow ghee made with Bilona method)\\nGau Amritam (Rs 2998/L) - https://amzn.to/3gR841M\\nAl Qusai (Rs 2615/L) - https://amzn.to/38MW6DG\\nEcoSvasthya (Rs 1770/L) - https://amzn.to/3fkcG04\\nGavyamart (Rs 1599/L) - https://amzn.to/3iWqC2r\\n\\nTHARPARKAR COW GHEE (A2 Desi cow ghee made with Bilona method)\\nKapiva (Rs 2598/L) - https://amzn.to/3gOYkFf\\nMarwari Wala's (Rs 2098/L) - https://amzn.to/38ZnCy5\\n\\nHARLIKAR COW GHEE (Desi cow native of Karnataka region.

Is Intermittent fasting a good weight loss diet? Is ketogenic diet healthy?\\n\\nBuy Nutrabox's Raw Whey Protein - https://nutrabox.in/collections/shop/products/nutrabox-raw-1-kg?variant=30011648704621\\nBuy Nutrabox's Curcumin dietary supplement - https://nutrabox.in/products/95-curcumin-and-piperine?variant=31683936747629 \\n\\nThe weight loss industry comes up with a new diet every now and then. With so many weight loss diets out there to choose the best one for you could be challenging. But don’t worry. To make things simple for you I went deep into all the popular weight loss diets and have ranked them from worst to best. So which is the best diet for weight loss or rather fat loss. Let us find out. I will also share with you what diet I follow to stay in shape. On the basis of practicality, effectiveness, health and pricing, I have categorised all the popular weight loss diets into 3 categories.\\n\\n00:42 - CATEGORY #1 - Weight Loss Diets Ranked from Worst to Best. These diets aim at short term rapid weight loss. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them punishment rather than a diet. But these appeal to people as they promise substantial weight loss in as little as 1 week.\\n01:39 - CATEGORY #2 - These diets are extremely popular and people swear by their effectiveness. However, the problem with these diets is that they are highly restrictive. They either miss out on any one major macronutrient or stress too much on another macronutrient. \\n03:50 - DISHONOURABLE MENTIONS - The dishonourable mentions include all those diets which deprive you of food or make you eat only one type of food. These diets are a strict no no.\\n04:12 - CATEGORY #3 - This category includes the best diets in my opinion. They not only promote sure shot fat loss but also improve the muscle density and overall health.\\n\\nFOODS & PRODUCTS RELATED TO THE VIDEO (Not Sponsored)\\n\\nRock Salt - https://amzn.to/2EVvQZW\\nA2 Cow Ghee - https://amzn.to/2SOWV9a\\nSemi Brown Rice -https://amzn.to/2S6QpH3\\nMillets - https://amzn.to/2SkUGGG\\nMultigrain Flour - https://amzn.to/2SUUP90\\nJaggery Powder - https://amzn.to/2yAF7CP\\nCopper Jug - https://amzn.to/2ZK4sHM\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM WORST TO BEST SERIES (My Recommendations) (NOT SPONSORED)\\nBest Shampoo - https://amzn.to/2JOFON2\\nBest Face wash - http://amzn.to/2FKXqsd\\nBest Deodorant - https://amzn.to/2qJ2R4M\\nBest Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2DdMgJw\\nBest Face Cream - https://amzn.to/2J4eVF4\\nBest Breakfast - https://amzn.to/2KADtWk\\nBest Instant Noodles - https://amzn.to/2GO0Jhd\\nBest Biscuits - https://amzn.to/2HRv1B7\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nMORE USEFUL LINKS\\n\\nCopper Jug that I recommend -https://amzn.to/2Gxth3I\\nBrass Kadhai that I recommend - https://amzn.to/2R48zfV\\nWater bottle that I use - https://amzn.to/2KtbcBg\\nGram Flour to prepare Chilla - https://amzn.to/2A7CZUA\\nSemi Brown Rice that I use - https://amzn.to/2GxWGuF\\nMulti grain Atta that I have used - https://amzn.to/2UTIwqR\\nBhuna Chana - https://amzn.to/2tOFdVa\\nRock Salt - https://amzn.to/2yTl5Xt\\nBlack salt - https://amzn.to/2ID0Pcd\\nJaggery - https://amzn.to/2MvV7vk\\nStevia - https://amzn.to/2tQzvBY\\nHoney - https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01CHL3Z42?tag=fittub-21\\nMillets - https://amzn.to/2KADtWk\\nOats - https://amzn.to/2ls1yUN\\nBrown Rice - https://amzn.to/2MyritZ\\nPeanuts - https://amzn.to/2MypnWp\\n\\n\\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS 📹\\n\\nThe Only Diet Plan That Ayurveda Recommends (Men & Women)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZUFT0CwU1w&t=176s\\n\\nFull day of Eating - Fat Loss Diet (Indian Style)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLLO3tEMkyk&t=494s\\n\\nFull day of Eating - Extreme Fat loss Diet - Lose 10 Kg\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMQfQK1_i8&t=1s\\n\\n12 Weight Loss Tips Ranked from Worst to Best\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vCt2JtHeE\\n\\n5 Reasons You Are Drinking Water the Wrong Way\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sOMfEAqzEg\\n\\n7 Quick & Healthy Breakfast Options for the Week (Ditch the Paranthas)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee0SfGSJOTc\\n\\n7 Quick & Healthy Lunch Box Ideas for the Week (Vegetarian)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4vAv6CG7M0&t=505s\\n\\n Quick & Healthy Evening Snacks For the Week (Vegetarian)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=110G3GvaZns&t=1s\\n\\n7 Healthy & Tasty Dinner Ideas for the Week (Vegetarian)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEzASBGeEIM&t=548s\\n\\n28 Signs Your Body is Deficient in Vital Nutrients (With Solution)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZlXdba7ALI\\n\\nMilk in India Ranked from Worst to Best\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZjGDwG5UU&t=135s\\n\\n5 Amazing Ways to Beat the Heat this Summer \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0cuX__wck&t=112s\\n\\nWhat your Poop Says about your Health?

What did the lab results show when the most popular brands of milk were tested? What’s up with A1 and A2 milk?\\n\\nBuy OZiva Plant Biotin - https://bit.ly/2M1xWef  \\nBuy OZiva Organic Plant Protein - https://bit.ly/2X8NlzL\\n(Apply Discount Coupon Code FT150 to get Rs 150 OFF)\\n\\nMilk is an integral part of a large population of India and around the world. Ayurvedic scriptures have glorified milk as a unique food which alone has all the nutrients required to nourish your whole body. But how true is that for the commercial milk that we drink today? To know the answer I have researched and broken down all the milk available in the Indian market into 4 major categories.\\n\\n00:37 - CATEGORY 1 - The milk in this category is generally the choice of people who have this habit of stacking food for weeks and months. Personally, I would not recommend you drink this milk.\\n01:29 -  CATEGORY 2 - The milk in this category is most popular and most commonly used by Indians. Adulteration in this milk has become a major concern of most people. What is the truth? Let us find out.\\n04:11 - CATEGORY 3 - This milk is definitely much better than the milk discussed in the previous categories. Even the west has begun to appreciate this milk. Indian govt has taken steps to make this milk available to general public.\\n05:34 - SPECIAL MENTIONS - These include milk powders, vegan milk, buffalo milk and some of the less available but highly nutritious Camel and Goat milk. What does Ayurveda talk about them? Let's dig in.\\n06:40 - CATEGORY 4 - The milk in this category the best available in India. We must understand that yielding milk from an animal is not just another manufacturing process. It is all about how natural the environment is for the cow, what is it being fed? Is there any artificial insemination going on or not? It all affects the quality of her milk. That is where the milk in this category stands out.\\n\\n✅  SUPPORT MY WORK and get exclusive perks \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw/join\\n\\nINSTAGRAM :  Follow and participate in Q&A session every Saturday at 11 AM \\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fittuber\\n\\nDESI COW MILK FARMS LOCATED ALL OVER INDIA (Not Sponsored)\\n\\nIn and near DELHI NCR\\n1. https://www.waywewere.net/\\n2. http://www.vakshi.com/\\n3. http://www.milkveda.com/ \\n4. http://www.vrindavanmilk.com/desi-cow-milk/\\n5. http://www.vrindamilk.com/home\\n6. http://www.piousmilk.com/index.php \\n\\nIn and near HYDERABAD\\n1. http://www.klimom.com/milk/\\n2. http://godesimilk.com/pure-desi-cow-a2-milk-in-hyderabad-city/ (Also Available in Chennai and Nagpur)\\n3. http://www.svsfarms.com/\\n4. https://www.krsnaa2milk.com/\\n5. http://www.charaka.co.in/\\n\\nIn and near MUMBAI\\n1. http://www.vitafarms.in/index.html\\n2. https://www.kesariyafarm.com/ \\n3. https://aumrut.com/ (They have Foreign Breed Cow milk as well.

USA of course is a super power and India in the recent past has imbibed a lot from the western ways of living. However, in this video I am going to compare the Modern American ways of living with our Ancient Indian style of living in 7 major categories. I will also share with you my personal take on the matter so that we can get the best of both the worlds. \\n\\n00:32 - CLOTHES. The way Indians and Americans dress show a lot about their mindsets. There are various reasons to why Americans preferred a certain types of clothes while Indians were more comfortable in another type of clothes.\\n01:31 - FOOD. There is a major difference in the ideologies of these two countries which is evident in the food choices the people living in India and USA make.\\n02:50 - EATING STYLE. There is a stark difference in the eating habits of ancient Indians and modern Americans. Why Americans prefer eating on a dining table? Why Indians pressed on eating on floor? Why Americans used cutlery while Indians believed that it's more appropriate to eat with hands?\\n03:39 - SUSTAINABILITY vs CONVENIENCE. There are many distinct habits of modern Americans and ancient Indians that suggest that Americans are more inclined towards convenience while Indians believed in sustainable living. \\n05:00 - WAYS OF LIVING. Indians are driven by certain set of principals while the Americans are driven by a different ideology. This is evident in their day to day life of people of both these countries.\\n06:01 - AREAS OF INNOVATION. There is no doubt about the fact that America has produced some of the most innovative products in the last century. America is the hub of new products and is a heart of innovation across the globe. Although, you will be surprised to know that even Ancient Indian innovation has been par excellence.\\n07:02 - PROACTIVE vs REACTIVE APPROACH. There are many ways one can conclude that Indians were more proactive whereas Americans have been reactive in approaching health and wellbeing. \\n09:08 - WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?

In this time of lockdown, most of us have time on our hands. So I couldn’t think of a better time to get you started with this practice. Just how you take your vehicle for servicing, even your body needs that service and care from you. Although, the focus of this age old routine is on body and self love, skin glow, radiance and mental peace are a few of its positive side effects. However, considering our busy lifestyles, I have tried to design this routine in such a way that it can be executed practically in an efficient manner. So just 1 hour on a Sunday morning will get the job done. This routine is for both men and women. So without any further delay, let’s get started.\\n\\n01:00 - Step 1 - Abhyanga. Abhyanga or self massage is any amazing way to energize your body. Do not miss out on oiling your navel. It has numerous benefits which I have discussed in the video. Foot massage is also very important and is linked to your eye health\\n02:52 - Step 2 - This includes special age old Ayurvedic packs to nourish the face and hair. \\n04:30 - Step 3 - This step includes feet cleansing, elbow cleansing, neck cleansing and more. This includes the cleansing at a physical level but has a deep connection at the subtle levels.\\n05:56 - Step 4 - Bathing. We won't be using soap here.\\n06:27 - Step 5 - Nourishing the brain. It is called Naasya kriya. It has some amazing positive effects on the brain.\\n06:56 - Step 6 - Eye cleansing. In today's modern lifestyle most of us sit in front of screens all the time. Eye cleansing is extremely important for us. Checkout the simplest yet the most effective way to cleanse the eyes.\\n\\nRELATED VIDEOS FOR MORE RECIPES 🍛 📹\\n7 Quick & Healthy Breakfast Options for the Week (Ditch the Paranthas)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee0Sf...\\n\\n7 Quick & Healthy Lunch Box Ideas for the Week (Vegetarian)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4vAv...\\n\\n7 Quick & Healthy Evening Snacks For the Week (Vegetarian)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=110G3...\\n\\n7 Healthy & Tasty Dinner Ideas for the Week (Vegetarian)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEzAS...\\n\\n7 Quick & Healthy Dessert Ideas for your Sweet Tooth (Indian Dessert Recipes)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLrny...\\n\\nMusic Credits : YouTube Audio Library \\n\\nI wish you good health.\\nFit Tuber\",\n",

To answer these questions, let’s delve into the ingredients. \\n05:45 - #2 Strepsils. When we are down with sore throat, cold or cough we look for an instant relief from that uncomfortable feeling.

These namkeen manufacturers are taking undue advantage of people’s good intentions to stay healthy.\\n05:46 - CATEGORY 3 - Now, these are the products which have shown good intentions to serve to you healthy but have just missed by a whisker. \\n06:53 - CATEGORY 4 - These are the best in the Indian market.

Well, to get an answer, I did examine many of our Ancient Classical texts and have also had conversations with multiple top notch modern medical doctors to understand both the perspectives.

Let’s face it. It’s not easy to deal with skin problems. Pimples, blemishes, spots keep coming in. You guys might have tried out numerous remedies but nothing seems to bring out that flawless skin.

In this video, I will share with you simple 4 step routine which will get you bring a natural glow to your face. And I should tell you that this skin care routine is is backed by thousands of years of research and is explicitly mentioned in our ancient texts as panacea for all skin issues.\\n\\n0:54 - Do this first thing in the morning to get glowing skin\\n01:04 - STEP 1 of this skin care routine which will heal your skin from within. It taps the root cause and increases the immunity of skin cells so that minor problems like pimples, itching, black heads are not more a botheration for you.\\n02:00 - STEP 2 of this skin care routine. This is important as it tightens the skin from the outside which gives a younger looking skin. Since most skin problems are due to excess Pitta in the body, it also cools down Pitta.\\n03:03 - STEP 3 of this Skin Care Routine. This is to moisturise the skin. How? Give your costly cosmetics a break and try this Ayurvedic oil mentioned in the ancient texts which is often described as Miraculous Elixir\\n03:52 - Take care of your face. Like how? Like this\\n04:25 - STEP 4 of this Skin Care Routine. No matter how well you take care of the skin, due to environmental factors, the skin tends to get dull.

But which breakfast cereal do you use? Kellogs chocos, cornflakes or patanjali? Do you what really goes in making your favourite so called healthy breakfast cereals? Sugar, invert syrups, liquid glucose, colours, preservatives, maida and malt extract to say the least. So, which is the best breakfast cereal in the Indian market? Let us find out.\\n\\n00:42 - Category #1 - These are the worst breakfast cereals in the Indian market. Unfortunately, these are favourite among most Indian kids. They are loaded with over 7.5 teaspoons sugar in one serving. That's near to the quantity of sugar in cola drinks. Apart from sugar, these breakfast cereals have preservatives, artificial flavours, colours, synthetic antioxidants, refined flours, refined flours and many more unwanted, unhealthy additives. Eating them daily means to gain unhealthy weight and diseases.\\n\\n01:27 - Category #2 - This category includes the breakfast cereals which make huge claims on their front labels. Like made from real fruit, real honey, fruits and nuts, no added sugar, with whole grain, with fibre of 1 roti, diet muesli, with added minerals and much more. Frankly speaking, there isn't much difference between the breakfast cereals in category #1 and those in category #2. These are the so called healthy breakfast cereals. Stay away from them too.\\n\\n.02:57 - What and how to check before buying a breakfast cereal?\\n\\n03:17 - Category #3 - These are the best breakfast cereals in the Indian market. With zero added sugar, no colours, no artificial flavours, no preservatives and other additives, these breakfast cereals are healthy in its true sense.\\n\\n04:58 - Video Partner - Manna \\nBuy Manna Health Mix - https://amzn.to/2U4HsQ7\\n(With no added sugar Manna health mix is a perfect blend of millets, pulses and dry fruits.

Which cookware is safe?\\n\\nDo you use non stick pans or aluminium vessels to cook your food? Or the pressure cooker is a part of your daily cooking? If yes then you might be unknowingly inviting serious health issues like Hypothyrodism, PCOD, loss of memory, complications of the heart, kidney and even cancer. So which is the safest cookware in the Indian market? To make things simpler for you I examined the most commonly available cookwares in the Indian market and on the basis of their toxicity have categorised them into 5 categories.\\n\\n01:03 - Category 1 - These is the worst cookware in the Indian market. What's disturbing is that more than 90% of the Indian urban homes use it. If you want to stay healthy, this cookware should be out of your kitchen.\\n\\n02:25 - Category 2 - This is also among the worst cookwares in the Indian market. It is also widely used by Indians.\\n\\n03:40 - Category 3 - These cookwares are definitely better than the ones in the previous two categories but are far from best. They too come with hidden dangers.\\n\\n04:45 - Category 4 - These cookwares are among the safe and practical options. Although, they do have certain limitations.\\n\\n06:00 - Dishonourable Mention - This video is incomplete without the mention of this cookware. It was never a part of Indian cooking heritage but now it is a household name. \\n\\n06:44 - Category 5 - This cookware is by far the best among all. It is the most scientific cookware ever made. What's great is that it is also cheap and available.\\n\\nUSEFUL LINKS (Not Sponsored)\\nClay handi for cooking - https://amzn.to/2H0suIJ\\nBrass Kadhai - https://amzn.to/2SBaKVH\\nPitambari powder to clean Brass Utensils - https://amzn.to/2VxTAKm\\nCast Iron Kadhai - https://amzn.to/2SLs5eR\\nStainless Steel Kadhai - https://amzn.to/2C3klh5\\n\\nBuy Healthy Sugar Alternatives for you and your family (NOT SPONSORED)\\n\\nStevia Dry Leaves - https://amzn.to/2yAF7CP\\nStevia Sachets - https://amzn.to/2EejePO\\nJaggery Powder - https://amzn.to/2yAF7CP\\nJaggery - https://amzn.to/2NEuQef\\nMishri -  https://amzn.to/2yeFXWF\\nHoney - https://amzn.to/2yenedR\\nDates Sugar - https://amzn.to/2yfz8E5\\nCoconut Sugar - https://amzn.to/2C8q5rv\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM WORST TO BEST SERIES (My Recommendations) (NOT SPONSORED)\\nBest Shampoo - https://amzn.to/2JOFON2\\nBest Face wash - http://amzn.to/2FKXqsd\\nBest Deodorant - https://amzn.to/2qJ2R4M\\nBest Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2DdMgJw\\nBest Face Cream - https://amzn.to/2J4eVF4\\nBest Breakfast - https://amzn.to/2KADtWk\\nBest Instant Noodles - https://amzn.to/2GO0Jhd\\nBest Biscuits - https://amzn.to/2HRv1B7\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nMORE USEFUL LINKS\\n\\nCopper Jug that I recommend -https://amzn.to/2Gxth3I\\nBrass Kadhai that I recommend - https://amzn.to/2R48zfV\\nWater bottle that I use - https://amzn.to/2KtbcBg\\nGram Flour to prepare Chilla - https://amzn.to/2A7CZUA\\nSemi Brown Rice that I use - https://amzn.to/2GxWGuF\\nMulti grain Atta that I have used - https://amzn.to/2UTIwqR\\nBhuna Chana - https://amzn.to/2tOFdVa\\nRock Salt - https://amzn.to/2yTl5Xt\\nBlack salt - https://amzn.to/2ID0Pcd\\nJaggery - https://amzn.to/2MvV7vk\\nStevia - https://amzn.to/2tQzvBY\\nHoney - https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01CHL3Z42?tag=fittub-21\\nMillets - https://amzn.to/2KADtWk\\nOats - https://amzn.to/2ls1yUN\\nBrown Rice - https://amzn.to/2MyritZ\\nPeanuts - https://amzn.to/2MypnWp\\n\\nMORE ON FIT TUBER\\n\\n5 Amazing Patanjali products you should try\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWRDGnsQX_k&t=261s&frags=pl%2Cwn\\n\\n10 Toothpastes in India Ranked from Worst to Best?\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWRDGnsQX_k&t=261s&frags=pl%2Cwn\\n\\nCustomized Oatmeal full recipe video:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6aFZgDcm-M&t=29s\\n\\nPaneer Stuffed Pesarattu full recipe video:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmnns9LDyHU\\n\\nFull day diet plan for Muscle Building:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2knVuQrz0oQ&t=294s\\n\\nFull day diet plan for fat loss:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/\\n\\nDiet Plan for weight loss \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X639... \\n\\nMusic Credits : YouTube Audio Library \\n\\nI wish you good health.\\nFit Tuber\",\n",

       "  'video_description': \"Which is the Best Chocolate in the Indian Market? 20 Chocolates in India Ranked from Worst to Best.\\n\\nThis video is powered by Olena. \\n\\nDid you know that chocolate is good for you ? Yes, The main ingredient used to make chocolate, cocoa, is known to have numerous health benefits. However, most chocolates available in the market hardly have any cocoa in them and are no less than chocolate colored sugar candies. Forget about health benefits, the harmful effects of eating these chocolates are many. So, is healthy chocolate a dream or reality? Well, watch this video till the end as I have found out the healthiest and the cheapest chocolate that you must try out this season.\\n\\nIn this video, I have Ranked 20 Most commonly eaten Chocolates in India from Worst to Best. \\n\\n00:50 - CATEGORY #1 - These are chocolate colored sugar candies. They have only 5-7% cocoa in them. The amount of sugar in just one bar is 6-7 tsps. On top of it, they have any unwanted fillers.\\n\\n01:25 - CATEGORY #2 - These are so called dark chocolates. Definitely, the percentage of cocoa is higher but the sugar is also no less. They also have some unwanted fillers.\\n\\n01:42 - CATEGORY #3 - These are definitely the best chocolates in the Indian market. Not only they have over 70% of cocoa but also have almost no sugar. These, however, are pricey as most of them are imported.\\n\\nBUY BEST CHOCOLATES IN THE INDIAN MARKET\\n\\nLindt - https://amzn.to/2xQ4Slz\\nJus Truf - https://amzn.to/2JEEqjA\\nBelgian - https://amzn.to/2M7GLln\\n\\n02:09 - BONUS CATEGORY - This includes a chocolate which is not only healthier as compared to most other chocolates in the market but also very pocket friendly. That chocolate is homemade.\\n\\nINGREDIENTS\\n\\nNatural Unsweetened Cocoa Powder - https://amzn.to/2sBCMWb\\nCold Pressed Coconut Oil - https://amzn.to/2kWBNvz\\nHoney - https://amzn.to/2kYdGg2\\nChocolate mould - https://amzn.to/2sSwUHd\\nWhisker - https://amzn.to/2xTMOHh\\n\\nMETHOD OF PREPARATION\\n\\nAdd 1/4 cup of cold pressed coconut oil in a cold saucepan. Immediately add 4 tbsp of honey. Whisk it for about 10 seconds just to get the honey mixed. Now, add 1/2 cup of Natural Unsweetened Cocoa powder. Rigorously whisk it for another 10 seconds. Make sure that the flame is at its lowest throughout the whole process. The glossy mixture formed should neither be runny nor thick, just the pouring consistency. Pour it in your favorite mould or any container and refrigerate for a few hours. That's all. Enjoy rich homemade dark chocolate.\\n\\nCAUTION - Avoid overheating the cocoa powder. The total process will hardly take a minute or two.\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM WORST TO BEST SERIES\\nBest Instant Noodles - https://amzn.to/2GO0Jhd\\nBest Biscuits - https://amzn.to/2HRv1B7\\nBest Shampoo - https://amzn.to/2JOFON2\\nBest Face wash - http://amzn.to/2FKXqsd\\nBest Deodorant - https://amzn.to/2qJ2R4M\\nBest Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2DdMgJw\\nBest Face Cream - https://amzn.to/2J4eVF4\\nBest Breakfast - https://amzn.to/2KADtWk\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nSOME USEFUL LINKS\\n\\nBuy Millets.

Basically, these hair conditioners provide short term benefit but in the long run may damage your hair and body. So, which is the best hair conditioner in the Indian market? Let us find out.\\n\\nHair conditioner, as the name suggests is meant to condition the hair. It is very important as it helps protect the hair by restoring the natural oils which the shampoo strips off. Conditioners are meant to add shine, softness and strength to hair. Although, if you are using the wrong conditioner, it might not have any positive effect on your hair even if the labels suggest otherwise.\\n\\n\\n01:57 - CATEGORY #1 - These are, in my opinion, worst of its kind. These have around 8 to 10 very harsh chemicals, synthetic colors and artificial fragrances.\\n\\n03:00 - CATEGORY #2 - These hair conditioners have 5-7 harsh chemicals in them. Definitely, better than the ones mentioned in the category #1 but still far from the best.\\n\\n03:37 - CATEGORY #3 - These are the hair conditioners brands which use over smart marketing tactics. These hair conditioners do not mention the complete list of ingredients. Not much can be said about them.\\n\\n05:00 - CATEGORY #4 - Free from harsh chemicals, sulfates, silicons, parabens, harmful chlorides, synthetic colors and artificial fragrances, these are best in the business.\\n\\nBUY BEST HAIR CONDITIONERS IN THE INDIAN MARKET\\n\\nJust Herbs Hair Conditioner - https://justherbs.in/product-category/hair/by-function/hair-conditioner/?v=c86ee0d9d7ed\\nVilvah Hair Conditioner - https://vilvahstore.com/collections/conditioner/products/natural-hair-conditioner-100-ml\\nOmVed Hair Conditioner - https://amzn.to/2J0czup\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM WORST TO BEST SERIES\\n\\nBest Instant Noodles - https://amzn.to/2GO0Jhd\\nBest Biscuits - https://amzn.to/2HRv1B7\\nBest Shampoo - https://amzn.to/2JOFON2\\nBest Face wash - http://amzn.to/2FKXqsd\\nBest Deodorant - https://amzn.to/2qJ2R4M\\nBest Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2DdMgJw\\nBest Face Cream - https://amzn.to/2J4eVF4\\nBest Breakfast - https://amzn.to/2KADtWk\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nSOME USEFUL LINKS\\n\\nBuy Millets.

Which Face Cream would best suit your skin type?\\n\\nBuy GULNARE Organic SKin Care Products by clicking here http://www.gulnareskincare.com/ \\n\\nFace Cream is a cream which once applied on face keeps it soft, wrinkle free and completely nourished. At least that’s what most companies promise to deliver. However, you will be shocked to know that 9 out of 10 most popular brands in India are selling face creams having cheap toxic chemicals which would do more harm than good. These face creams may deliver short term smoothness and brightness but it may cause acne breakouts, expose you to cancer causing pesticides, age your skin prematurely and what not. So, if you genuinely wish to keep your face young and glowing, you should know the best face cream available in the Indian market.\\n\\nIn search of the best Face Cream in the Indian market I picked up almost 20 Face Creams, some from the supermarket while others online.\\nAfter thorough analysis, I have sorted out all these Face Creams into 3 categories on the basis of number of toxic chemicals present in them.\\n\\n0:59 - CATEGORY #1 - These Face creams have 8 or more toxic chemicals in them. Many of these chemicals have been known to interfere with the thyroid gland. Some of these chemicals have the capacity to cross the skin and get into other tissues in the body. Basically, they are the worst in the market.\\n\\n01:38 - CATEGORY #2 - These Face Creams claim to be non cosmetic and Ayurvedic but it does not mention the complete list of ingredients. However, they do contain some harmful preservatives and synthetic colors.\\n\\n02:43 - CATEGORY #3 - Face Creams by these brands have nothing to hide as they have mentioned the complete list of ingredients. These Face creams are safe and natural in their true sense.\\n\\n03:46 - Probably the Best Skin Care Brand in India - GULNARE Organic Skincare - http://www.gulnareskincare.com/\\n\\nSoultree Nourishing Face Cream - https://amzn.to/2pSrJX6\\nMamaEarth Bye Bye Blemishes - https://amzn.to/2T9Zsrg\\nJust Herbs Pimple Treatment Cream - https://amzn.to/2GmgdcU\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nSource: http://www.biodizionario.it/\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

Sun is the source of energy on this planet, however prolonged exposure to the UV rays of the sun may lead to sunburn, fast ageing and in some cases even skin cancer. So applying a sunscreen on a daily basis becomes extremely important. However, it is shocking that most commercial sunscreens in the market are full of toxic chemicals like oxybenzone, parabens, mineral oil, BHT and many others which not only harm the skin but also completely block the absorption of the Vitamin D in the body, of which the sun is a major source.\\nSo, what choice do we have? Obviously, we want to protect ourselves from the harmful radiations of the sun but at the same time we don’t want a toxic sunscreen to damage our skin. \\n\\nIn search of the best sunscreen in the Indian market I picked up almost 15 sunscreens, some from the supermarket while others online.\\nAfter an in-depth analysis, I have sorted out all these sunscreens into 3 categories on the basis of number of toxic chemicals present in them.\\n\\n01:42 - CATEGORY #1 - These sunscreen creams have 10 or more toxic chemicals in them. Many of these chemicals have been known to interfere with the thyroid gland. Some of these chemicals have the capacity to cross the skin and get into other tissues in the body. Basically, they are the worst in the market.\\n\\n02:33 - CATEGORY #2 - These sunscreens claim to be non cosmetic and Ayurvedic but it does not mention the complete list of ingredients. However, they do contain some harmful chemicals.\\n\\n03:33 - What is Sun Protection Factor (SPF) number really means?\\n\\n04:35 - CATEGORY #3 - Sunscreens by these brands have nothing to hide as they have mentioned the complete list of ingredients. These sunscreens are safe and natural in their true sense.\\n\\n05:40 - Was this video sponsored?\\n\\nAroma Magic Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2oVPX29\\nLass Naturals Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2p3xkZp\\nGreenberry Organics Sunscreens - http://amzn.to/2DdMgJw\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nSource: http://www.biodizionario.it/\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

Because if you are using one of these, you surely are unaware of the high number of toxic chemicals present in them. It is unfortunate that most face washes in the market today are full of harmful chemicals. \\nFrom Parabens to sulfates to alcohols to synthetic colors and fragrances face washes have them all. Many of these synthetic chemicals are skin irritants, skin penetrators and even carcinogenic. The skin on our face is much thinner than that on our body and accordingly needs more care. However, using a toxic face wash on a daily basis does more harm to it than good. \\n\\nThere are chemicals which are safe. There are chemicals which are not exactly safe but are also not very toxic. However, there are some chemicals which are extremely toxic and should be avoided at all costs. I have segregated all these face washes into 4 categories on the basis of number of these highly toxic chemicals in them.\\n\\n01:33 - CATEGORY 1 - These are the worst of the kind. They have over 10 toxic chemicals along with harmful preservatives, artificial fragrances and synthetic colors.\\n\\n02:23 - CATEGORY 2 - These are better than those in the category #1 but are far from the best. They too have 5-7 toxic chemicals in them. They however are free from sulphates.\\n\\n02:47 - CATEGORY 3 - These are one of its kind. They do not mention the complete list of their ingredients. However, they do contain harmful and toxic preservatives.\\n\\n04:13 - CATEGORY 4 - These are best in the market, free from toxic chemicals, harmful preservatives, artificial colors, fragrances and even excipients.\\n\\nSource: http://www.biodizionario.it/\\n\\nAroma Magic Face Wash- http://amzn.to/2FKXqsd\\nRustic Art Face Wash- http://amzn.to/2CTDlg4\\nGulnare Face Wash - http://www.gulnareskincare.com\\n\\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM WORST TO BEST SERIES\\n\\nBest Shampoo - https://amzn.to/2JOFON2\\nBest Face wash - http://amzn.to/2FKXqsd\\nBest Deodorant - https://amzn.to/2qJ2R4M\\nBest Sunscreen - http://amzn.to/2DdMgJw\\nBest Face Cream - https://amzn.to/2J4eVF4\\n\\n\\nMY GEAR\\nCamera - http://amzn.to/2t7uXdv\\nMic - http://amzn.to/2oKxLYq\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

From food products to cosmetics to other personal care products, they have more than 900 products in the market. Let’s clear the air a bit. Patanjali is not a full fledged manufacturer. It’s a marketing company, which outsources it’s manufacturing to other approved parties or manufacturers and then supplies and markets the products under it’s brand name - Patanjali. Patanjali is the fastest growing FMCG company in India with their total valuation being over 30 billion rupees. Since it’s inception people in India have gone crazy as their products are sold under the umbrella of Ayurveda. For this video, I have picked up 5 products manufactured under the name of Patanjali which are widely used in Indian homes. We will go through them one by one and find out if they are really worth the craze. Before we move further, I want to make it clear that I am not with or against Patanjali or any other brand for that matter. I buy a product on it’s merit. I go through the nutritional information and it’s ingredients. If I feel it’s good for me, I buy it. Then it doesn’t matter if it is made by Patanjali or Cadbury. Having said this, let’s get started.\\n\\nI have reviewed the following 5 PATANJALI PRODUCTS:\\n\\n1. Patanjali's Dant Kanti Toothpaste.\\n2. Patanjali's Oats\\n3. Patanjali's Chyawanprash\\n4. Patanjali's Mixed Fruit Jam\\n5. Patanjali's Whole Wheat Digestive Cookies\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

       "  'video_description': '5 Weight Loss Mistakes that most people do. \\nAre you finding it difficult to lose weight? Are you not able to lose fat from your body? If yes, then this video is for you. In this video, I will share with you the most common weight loss and fat loss mistakes.\\n\\n00:25 - Weight Loss Mistake # 1 - Stop measuring your progress in Kgs and start measuring it in inches. \\nYes. Suppose you start working out and after a few days you step on weighing scale and you see that you have not reduced even a single kg. Well, let that number not decide how well you are doing. Watch out the video to know what you should be doing.\\n\\n01:11 - Weight Loss Mistake #2 - Doing wrong workout.\\nMost people think that doing cardiovascular exercise on a treadmill, running for long period of time will help them reduce a lot of weight. This is not true. Cardio training is great for heart health but it is not ideal for weight loss. \\n\\n02:02 - Weight Loss Mistake # 3 - Underestimating the calories.\\n In order to lose weight, a person should consume calories less than the maintenance calories. Everybody knows that. But what many people don’t know is that how many calories a particular food contains. And in this process they end up underestimating the calories that they have consumed. A study shows that people tend of underestimate the calories by as much as 50%. This is one of the major reasons why people fail to lose weight. \\n\\n02:53 - Weight Loss Mistake # 4 - Overloading yourself.\\nDoing weight loss is not a one or two day process. It is a journey in itself. It demands you to change your various eating habits. Now, if you suddenly subject yourself to a hardcore diet and start working out along with it, there are high chances that you get frustrated in between and stop the journey altogether. So, it is always better to take small steps. \\n\\n03:53 - Weight Loss Mistake # 5 - Making it Uncomfortable  Unfortunately, for many people the idea of a weight loss diet is starvation. People who skip their breakfast, lunch actually eat like a dinosaur in their dinner. Never make this mistake. This is simply because starvation is not sustainable. Nor is it healthy. Similarly, some people after working out will take the liberty and pamper themselves with delicious food outside. This happens because they have put themselves into uncomfortable position which are not sustainable for long. Never do this mistake.\\n\\nSo Friends! I hope you found this video helpful.

How to stop hair fall for men and women?\\n\\nHair fall and hair thinning are one of the most common problems faced by both men and women today. As much as 25% of the men below the age of 21 years suffer from hair loss. And 45% of the women suffer from hair thinning at some point of their life.\\n\\n Let us talk about it’s major reasons and the do’s and don’ts to fix it. \\n \\nMistake #1 00:33 - You aren't saving your hair from excessive heat.\\nMistake #2  00:42 - You use a shampoo which contains sulphate.\\nMistake #3  00:53 - You don't wash the products before going to sleep at night. \\nMistake #4  00:59 - You brush hair when they are wet. \\nMistake #5  01:04  - You tier hair tightly all the time.  \\nMistake #6  01:12 - You take a lot of stress.\\n\\nNow, let us talk about the 3 major causes of hair fall and the ways to fix it. \\n\\n 01:26  - #1 Cause - Poor Blood Circulation \\nThe nutrients in our body flow through blood.

This is because the nutrients are not able to reach the scalp area. \\nWatch out for 2 most effective ways to improve the blood circulation in your scalp area.\\n\\n02:27 - #2 Cause - Rise in DHT \\nAnother major cause of hair loss is due to the rise in the levels of dihydrotestosterone. Almost 90% of the hair loss in men is due to the rise in DHT. \\nSome DHT blocking foods are Fenugreek seeds, Almonds, Banana, Tomato, Carrots, Mushrooms, pumpkin seeds, watermelon, walnuts, peanuts, spinach, mangoes, coriander etc.\\n \\n03:18 - #3 Cause is Poor Nutrition. \\nPoor nutrition is the most important reason as to why the hair of both men and women start to thin out at a very early age. If the body is devoid of nutrients for a very long time, one thing it can afford is to lose hair. Body thinks that it can survive without a single hair on the head. So, it stops making hair and takes care of the other vital organs. So, any hormonal imbalance or lack or nutrients, hair has to pay the price. These days, fast foods, fad diets, cola, artificial sweeteners, artificial juices, processed foods are very much a part of every teenagers diet. This needs to be fixed. \\nWatch out for the best foods that should be in your diet to stop hair fall.\\n\\nIf you apply these basic tips in your life, you will see that you will stop losing your hair. \\nSo Friends!

       "  'video_description': 'BIGGEST Fitness Myths that you need to STOP believing immediately. There are many fitness myths that prevail, specially in Indian society, which are taking toll over your fitness goals. These needs to be busted as soon as possible.\\nOne who is looking to lose weight, should not eat Almonds, Cashews, Peanuts, Walnuts because they are high in fat. A myth. If somebody is looking to lose weight, he/she should not be eating post 6 PM. Again, a myth. This is just the tip of the iceberg.\\nIn this video, we will bust 5 fitness myths which are so popular that we now actually believe them to be true. \\n\\nMyth #5 - 00:29 - Weight Training Stunts Growth \\n\\nTeenagers specially in India don’t go for weight training or they are not allowed to enter the gyms by their parents, thinking that weight training will stop their height. Well, this is completely untrue. No studies have ever been able to show that lifting weights inhibits or stunts growth. \\n\\nMyth #4 - 01:33 -  Eating Eggs and Nuts cause acne. \\n\\nSince childhood, we have been instructed to stay away from eggs and nuts. Specially in summers because they cause body heat, pimples, acne and what not. Well, this is also one major myth which needs to be busted. Eating nuts do not cause pimples. Pimples are formed when the dirt and oil is stuck in between the pores of your skin. It is high time we debunk this myth and stop compromising on a balanced diet because of the weather conditions. \\n\\nMyth #3 - 02:48  Spot Reduction can be done\\n.\\nNow, many people ask this question that how can they reduce fat from their thighs? Or how can they reduce fat only from the arms? Well, fortunately or unfortunately one can not reduce fat from the specific parts of the body. \\n\\nMyth #2  - 03:20  - Girls should not do Weight Training because they will get Bulky. \\n\\nMost girls refrain from lifting weight because they think that it might make their body bulky like that of boys. Well, this is also a very common myth which needs to be busted as soon as possible. The major reason as to why boys get a muscular body is because of the hormone called testosterone. The quantity of testosterone present in women is very less. \\n\\nMyth #1 - 04:14 - One can not Lose Weight without Exercising. \\n\\nNow, I have come across many people who think that they are not able to lose weight because they are very busy and have no time to exercise. If you are also one of them, who is looking to lose weight but is too busy to exercise then I have a good news for you. \\n\\nSo friends, these were some of the myths which I thought were very common and needed to be busted. \\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

       "  'video_description': '6 Ways to Boost Testosterone Naturally? \\n\\nTestosterone is a male hormone which is responsible for the growth of muscle mass. It is responsible for the growth of hair on your body. It improves sex drive, bone density and strength. \\nOur body produces testosterone naturally. But because of poor lifestyle, low test levels in males is a common problem. Because of which they find it difficult to build muscles. They start to lose out hair at a very early age and many other problems. Some people inject testosterone in the form of drugs. We must know that once we start doing this, our body stops producing testosterone naturally. This is not an ideal condition and it has a lot of side effects. \\n\\nSo in this video I’m going to share with you 6 ways by which you can boost your testosterone naturally. \\n\\n#1 WAY - NUTRITION - 00:51 \\n\\n The foods that we eat impact our hormones in a positive or a negative way. Needless to say, one should maintain a balanced diet. Specifically talking about testosterone, there are three ingredients that should be in your diet on a daily basis. These are Zinc, Vitamin D and Fats. \\n\\n#2 WAY - EXERCISE - 02:00\\n\\n The right type of exercise can have a dramatic effect on the production of testosterone. Specially weight training, when done even 3 to 4 times a week can boost your testosterone levels considerably. Studies have suggested that the higher the intensity of workout is, the greater will the response of testosterone. \\n\\n#3 WAY - SLEEP - 02:41\\n\\n When it comes to sleep, it is always about quality and not quantity. After you wake up in the morning from a good sound sleep, your test levels are at peak and slowly they drop by the evening. In order to have deep sleep, you can do two things.\\n\\n#4 WAY - REDUCE STRESS - 03:14\\n\\n When we are stressed out, our body produces a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is inversely proportional to testosterone. That means the higher the level of cortisol in the body, the lower will be the testosterone. Apart from this, there are many disadvantages of having a high cortisol levels in the body. So one should make an effort to reduce the stress levels. \\n\\n#5 WAY - AVOID SOME THINGS - 03:43\\n\\n Now, there are 3 things that you should avoid or keep them in moderation when it comes to boosting your testosterone levels.  All three effect the body in such a way that it starts producing less amount of testosterone. \\n\\n# 6 WAY - LOSE WEIGHT - 03:58\\n\\nIf you are overweight, shedding a few kilos can increase your testosterone levels. According to studies, overweight men are more likely to have low testosterone levels. So basically, if you follow the points that we have already discussed, you will be able to optimise your bodyweight. \\n\\nSo friends, these were some of the best and the most effective ways to boost your testosterone levels naturally. \\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

       "  'video_description': \"Ectomorph? Mesomorph? Endomorph? What body type are you? How to train and eat for your body type?\\nLet's dig into it.\\n\\nIn this video, we will talk about the three basic body types namely the Ectomorph, the Mesomorph and the Endomorph. My idea of making this video is that you get to identify which of these body types you fall under and accordingly what kind of workout and what kind of diet is best suited to you. So that you get the best possible results.\\n\\n#1 Body Type - ECTOMORPH - 00:27\\n\\nEctomorphs are the typical hardgainers. They tend of narrow shoulders, small frame and overall a skinny look. Ectomorphs find it really difficult to gain weight or put on muscle mass. They naturally have a very low body fat percentage. \\n\\n#2 Body Type - MESOMORPH -  02:30\\n\\nMesomorph is probably the best body type to be a part of. They naturally have a symmetrical build, wide shoulders, narrow waist. A mesomorph finds it quite easy to put on muscle. Also they tend to lose body fat quite effectively. Mesomorphs are generally quite muscular and bodybuilding comes naturally to them. \\n\\n#3 Body Type - ENDOMORPH - 03:22 \\n\\nThey have a soft round build. They tend to put on fat very easily because of which they generally struggle to lose weight.  \\n\\nSo these were the 3 basic body types. Now, just because we have talked about three body types, it doesn’t mean that you have to fit completely into one of these. \\n\\nYou can easily be a combination of ectomorph and mesomorph or endomorph and mesomorph. But essentially the idea was to help you understand what your body type is. Because when we know what our body type is we can accordingly workout and eat to get the best possible results. \\n\\nSo friends! I hope you found this video helpful.

       "  'video_description': 'Lowest Budget Muscle Building Diet plan for Students, Maintain healthy diet while living in hostel or PG, Full day of eating  Indian bodybuilding diet for students living in hostel and PG. A low budget bodybuilding diet plan for students living in hostel or PG.\\n\\nIn this video, I am going to share a muscle building diet plan for students who are living in hostel or PG. Now, I have been living away from my home for over 11 years now. And in these 11 years, I have lived in various hostels and PGs. So I assure that all the meals that we are going to discuss today are very much practical in hostel or PG life. Moreover, I completely understand that in student life, we do not have a lot of money to spend on diet. Taking this into consideration, this diet plan is very low in budget yet it is perfect for muscle building. I have shared  with you the cost breakup of each meal and at the end of this video, I have shared the monthly budget. \\n\\nMEAL 1 - BREAKFAST\\n\\nWhen I was in hostel for breakfast we used to get aloo puri, bhature chhole, paranthas, dosas and all that oily stuff. I would suggest you to avoid it. Along with this I am quite sure that you would be getting one glass of milk. So, we will be using this milk to make a well balanced and a tasty oatmeal.\\n\\nMEAL 2 - MID MORNING SNACK\\n\\nThis is that point of the time, when you are busy attending classes and you would want to have something which is very easy to carry. So, I would suggest you to have 50 grams of bhuna chana along with one handful of unsalted roasted peanuts. These are two things which are very easily available in the Indian market. Together, they form a great combination of complex carbohydrates, protein and healthy fats. \\n\\nMEAL 3 - LUNCH\\n\\nWhenever we go to the hostel mess, the table is set in such a way that there is rice, chapati, dal, curry, curd and salad. Eating in a hostel mess is all about making the smart choices.\\n\\nMEAL 4 - PRE WORKOUT MEAL\\n\\nFor pre workout meal we need a lot of carbohydrates so that we stay energised throughout the workout. And also, a little bit of protein. So, I will give you three options. You take your pick.\\n\\nMEAL 5 - POST WORKOUT MEAL\\n\\nPost workout meal is one of the most important meals of the day. I would suggest you to have 6 egg whites along with two bananas. Egg whites because it is a fast digesting lean source of protein. And bananas help replenish the glycogen and prevent muscle soreness. \\n\\nMEAL 6 - DINNER\\n\\nFor dinner, when we go to the mess, we see that the food options on the table are similar to the way they were in lunch. Again, the trick is to choose the best and leave the rest.\\n\\nMEAL 7 - BEFORE BED MEAL\\n\\nBefore bed meal is very important specially living in hostels because we don’t have this habit of sleeping early.\\n\\nSo friends, I hope you found this video helpful.

       "  'video_description': 'In this video I will share with you the cheapest and the best protein rich foods which are also very easily available in India. People in India often feel that bodybuilding is a costly affair. However, it is not true. One need not depend on high end protein supplements as there are enough protein rich foods around us which are cheap and best.  This top 10 list includes 7 vegetarian and 3 non-vegetarian sources. So, the myth that there are not enough protein sources for vegetarians would also be busted in this video.\\nProtein is an essential part of our diet. An average person who has a sedentary lifestyle, even his/her body requires about 1 gram of protein per kg body weight on a daily basis. For example, if a person who weighs 60 kg and he/she does not workout, even then his/her body requires about 60 grams of protein daily. Protein is very essential for the daily repair of the body, skin health and hair health. Eating enough protein not only helps to build and maintain muscle but it also helps in reducing the junk food cravings. Eating a protein deficient diet may reduce metabolism and energy levels.\\nSome protein sources are incomplete while others are incomplete. A protein source which has all the 9 essential amino acids viz. histidine,isoleucine,leucin, lysine, methoinine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine is said to be complete. Most vegetarian sources are incomplete. Howevever, there is a way to make vegetarian sources complete which I have discussed in this video.\\nSo, I have identified 10 cheap and best protein rich food sources and have ranked them solely on the basis of cost effectiveness. You will be surprised to know that there are a few protein rich foods from which you can get 25 grams of protein in just 10 rupees. How great is that?\\n\\n00:45 - TOFU\\n01:39 - FISH\\n02:27 - PANEER\\n03:33 - CHICKEN BREAST\\n04:07 - LEGUMES\\n04:57 - MILK\\n05:26 - EGG WHITES\\n05:59 - PEANUTS\\n06:37 - LENTILS\\n07:36 - WHEY PROTEIN\\n08:05 - NUTS\\n08:26 - SOY CHUNKS\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.\\n\\nWell, if you did, please do\\n\\nLIKE | SHARE | COMMENT\\n\\nTo SUBSCRIBE\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw\\n\\nI wish you good health.\\nFit Tuber',\n",

But do you even have any control over your height? Well, the short answer is yes, to some extent. More specifically 80% of your height depends on genetic factors which are obviously not under your growth and 20% of it depends on environmental factors which are under your control.\\nTalking about genetics, if both your parents are short that does not mean that you have to go through the same fate. Height is a polygenic trait. So if there is anybody in your family tree who is tall, chances are that the tall genes could be passed on to you.\\nGenerally, men grow till the age of 21 years and women till the age of 18 years. But there is no fixed rule and exceptions could be seen.\\nThe pituitary gland in our body secretes human growth hormone (HGH) which is responsible for muscle and bone growth. \\nSo, in this video I have shared with you 6 ways and 1 home remedy by which you can stimulate your human growth hormone (HGH) and push your height.\\n\\n1. DIET FOR HEIGHT. WHAT FOODS YOU SHOULD EAT TO GROW TALLER.\\n2. HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU NEED TO GROW TO YOUR MAXIMUM HEIGHT\\n3. GROWTH INHIBITORS\\n4. EXERCISES TO INCREASE HEIGHT\\n5.

Indian diet for weight loss.How to avoid junk food? Indian snacks for weight loss? How to maintain healthy diet in office?\\n\\nWhen we are in office, we feel hungry in the evening. We head to the nearest food court and we can't find anything healthy. So we end up eating something that our body has to regret. This is because we did not carry a healthy snack option with us. Well, not anymore.\\n\\nHere I present to you 8 Easy and Healthy Snack option ideas for office, school, college or whenever you are travelling. Now, you are already familiar with these foods but it is all about combining them in the right way so that the snack becomes balanced and your body feels satiated.\\n\\n1. Phool Makhane/Makhane/Lotus Seeds/Fox Nuts - Fox Nuts are low in calories and high in minerals. They are a major source of carbohydrates. They are rich in protein and also have some amount of protein. They are super low in sodum which makes them a great snacking option for someone suffering from high blood pressure. They can be combined with roasted peanuts for healthy fats and extra protein.\\n\\n2. Bhuna Chana/Roasted Chickpeas - They are also very tasty and filling. Majorly, a source of complex carbohydrates but also have some amount of protein. They can be combined with roasted peanuts for healthy fats and extra protein.\\n\\n3. Fruits & Nuts - A piece of fruit might not be enough to fill your tummy. However, combing it with nuts makes it not only balanced but also satiating.\\n\\n4. Banana Peanut Butter Roti - This is a great snack option to have on the go. It is well balanced, tasty and healthy.\\n\\n5. Carrots and Cucumbers - Now only carrots and cucumbers may not fill you up.So you combine them with roasted chickpeas and roasted peanuts. This is how you can combine different foods for different macro nutrients. Needless to say, it makes you more satiated.\\n\\n6. Boiled Chana Chaat - This is one of my favorite. Very simple and very tasty. \\n\\n7. Egg White Chaat -  Similar to boiled chana chaat with extremely high protein. This is a great way to fight the bland taste of egg whites.\\n\\n8. Egg white bhurji/Egg white omelette - Again, high in protein and very filling. You can eat egg whites in summers as well.\\n\\nThe serving size and macro nutrients of each snack option is mentioned in the video.\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful.

How to stay fit when there is no access to homemade food? \\n\\nDo these questions bother you? Well, don't worry my friend. I have few tips for you. \\n\\n- Make smart choices when you sit in the hostel mess to eat. For example, prefer dal over that oily curry. Whole wheat roti over rice. \\n\\n- Buy oats. Best thing about them is that you need not cook them.  Checkout this healthy breakfast recipe. You can replicate this living in hostel as well.\\n\\n- Add oats to hot dals and curries. This makes it a great alternative to white rice.\\n\\n- To fulfill daily protein intake in hostel, request your hostel warden/PG owner to get you boiled eggs. You can pay extra accordingly. Mixing 5-6 egg whites in dals/curries will make them protein rich.\\nEgg hacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzok4V-mqQ&t=4s\\n- If keeping a kettle is allowed in your hostel/PG, buy it. It will be handy. \\nHere is the link: http://amzn.to/2nv3LB9\\n\\n- Similarly, you can get paneer boiled and add it into curries to make them protein rich.\\n\\n- Eat salads every time you get them.\\n\\n- Eating healthy fats is not a problem. Nuts, seeds are good options. Checkout this video to know more food options.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6whI1dKlJn4&t=3s\\n- Workout. Now, I have made a workout at home series wherein you can workout in hostel without any equipment. Click the link below.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcRz4VIxQeo&t=4s\\n\\n- Drink enough water. There is a way to drink water as well. Make sure you checkout this video.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFjyrjw5HPc&t=16s\\n\\n- Stay away from junk food. If you can’t get over the junk food cravings. Checkout this video:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hFr16_3cuI&t=2s\\n\\n- Sleep well at proper timings.\\n\\n- Do not indulge in smoking or drinking.\\n\\nI hope you found this video helpful, if you did do \\n\\nLIKE | SHARE | COMMENT\\n\\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw\\n\\nThanks for visiting.\\n\\nI wish you good health.\\nFit Tuber.\",\n",

It is thought to be caused by an when the female sex hormone increases a little too much as compared to the it\\'s male counterpart, the androgen.\\n\\nMan boobs are common in new born babies but it hardly stays for 2-3 weeks. Then, it is also common in older males due to natural decline in testosterone. \\nBut, it is a major problem when it comes to adolescents.

Cut down Alcohol\\n\\nAlcohol intake produces a suppression of plasma testosterone. \\n\\n3. Take no stress\\n\\nI understand that this physical condition can be really embarrassing.

Well, I have talked about healthy fats in detail in my grocery shopping video. Check it out by clicking on this link.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6whI1dKlJn4&t=3s\\n\\n5. Sleep well\\n\\nAgain, lack of sleep can decrease our testosterone levels. So make sure you take a sound sleep of 7-8 hours daily. \\n\\n6. Leg workouts\\n\\nEven a single leg workout session can improve the testosterone levels drastically. So, do not miss your leg workouts especially when you are dealing with man boobs. \\n\\n7. Gyno workout\\n\\nSome of the specific exercises which will help you get rid of extra chest fat are bench press, inclined dumbbell press, pull over and dumbbell fly. There are some great push up exercises which will help you lose the chest fat. One of the most effective are close grip push ups, inclined push ups, elevated hand push ups.\\nCheckout my chest workout at home video wherein I share with you 9 different types of push ups which hit almost all areas of the chest.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcRz4VIxQeo&t=4s\\n\\nTo add, one must avoid junk foods when suffering from this physical condition. However, if you are not able to control your cravings, checkout this video which may be very useful to you.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hFr16_3cuI&t=2s\\n\\n In 75% of the cases, man boobs disappear automatically within a span of 18-24 months. However, even after following these tips if you are not able to get rid of them, I would suggest you to consult a doctor. \\n\\nDid you find this video helpful?

Surely, these three are the pillars of fitness. However, in order to keep the pillars standing strong and tall, it is important to stay motivated.\\nMotivation is only factor that keeps us going. Motivation keeps usnergized while we patiently approach towards our goal.\\nMost people accept the way their bodies are.They lose the hope, the zeal.They fail to realize that their bodies, no matter what, are capable of a change. We must believe that our bodies are the gift of nature. They deserve to be respected. They deserve our love. \\nLet us not degrade this precious gift of nature.

It may help.\\n\\nA few months back, I got a chance to join this gym where there was a bunch of equipment for body weight exercises. But there was one that had my special attention. It was a horizontal ladder like thing. I saw somebody jumping on it. It was very cool but at the same time it seemed to be tough. I thought of giving it a TRY. WHEN I FIRST TRIED, I FAILED. When I tried the second time, I failed again and again and again... TRY after TRY; I realized that it was actually not tough physically. It was more of a mental challenge. Every time when I was trying to jump, my mind used to tell me that I would fall. This was the reason that even after trying for so many times I was not able to do it. BUT I DID NOT GIVE UP. Instead, I PRACTICED. Slowly I was able to make my mind change its opinion. Guess what, I was now able to do it. I practiced more UNTIL I WAS GOOD AT IT. More practice… GOOD GOT BETTER. More practice…. BETTER GOT EVEN BETTER.  It was an unbelievable experience. I was doing it better than anybody else in my gym could do. So much so that whenever I used to do it, I was watched by my gym mates. People in the gym started asking me that how was I able to jump off the ladder so easily. Haha… SO EASY! Was it??? \\nSo, if you want to achieve something; all you need to do is get up and TRY. As now I believe that “THE GREATEST FAILURE IN LIFE IS THE FAILURE TO TRY”.\\nThanks for Reading.

Our ancestors used to hunt, and eat animal meat and organs and they used to survive, since the introduction of farming , some group of people shifted towards veg, also it has been shown that vegetarian foods lead to vitamin deficiency , which is more common in vegans that vegetarians. animal meat contains almost everything required for humans to survive without any issues. moreover, consuming only eggs and potatoes can keep you healthy for a long period of time. i know the topic i am topic about is kind of maybe biased but i hope everyone is also aware about the fact that Fittuber himself being a vegeterian will promote veg stuffs for sure. western studies shows that consuming animal meat with fats are totally safe and recommended for every individuals out there. it also shows that animal meat reduces cardiovascular disease.

Almost none of the vegetarian proteins are &quot;whole&quot; proteins and miss key amino acids unlike eggs or whey protein. You would need to know what proteins contain leucine and combine it with at least 1 source of leucine per day for the proteins to be effective for muscle repair/building. I would have appreciated if you explained that.<br><br>Some things are also much harder from a practical perspective for eg. replacing channa powder with whey is just not feasible for everyone considering the protein to calorie ratio. There are many smaller details that are overlooked or not mentioned. Please note: 100 grams of &quot;raw&quot; lentils have 15 grams of protein. When you cook 100 grams of channa or some other lentil it is a massive portion and nowhere close to 100 grams. You would effectively have to eat so much more just to get 15 grams of protein.',\n",

       "  'Comment_text': 'I grew up in Bangalore in the 60s and 70s when there were no packaged food available. We used to get all flour milled.<br><br>Now I continue that after trying the branded flours for a while. I have shifted to getting my flours - Wheat, rice, Ragi - milled. I have not tried to source desi varieties. I don’t mix grains but I do add Jowar flour or other millet flours in small quantities. Jowar flour is also milled by a friend of mine who gives me some. Other millet flours like foxtail, little millet or even barley I buy from store. <br><br>Coming to wheat flour, I use a wheat variety which is called Samba or Java. I am told that it is the wheat from which lapsi rava (Bansi rava) is made. It is a little tough and we have to mix the flour with hot water and let it rest little longer than other types. The chapathis are very tasty and we can clearly feel that it has more fibre. Plus getting it millled to a very slightly coarse consistency gives a nice texture to the chapathis. My children and even young grandsons love this. <br><br>I don’t know much about this wheat. Like it’s GI, nutrition etc. I would appreciate if you can share some information on Java wheat if possible. Also not many have heard of Samba wheat ...are Java and Samba one and the same? <br><br>Thank you for sharing this video.',\n",

       "  'Comment_text': 'I hated that Savanna wanted to wait because she was worried about money for the drama club.  Her character was showing some shallowness, but she always came around showing us she wasn&#39;t really actually as shallow as she appears.   I thought this was pretty weird for the character.. for all of them really.  As if something like this would have stopped a real life Colin from stopping a play knowing what he found out!  The sudden 100% flip of concern was strange.  No one would do that.  I&#39;m from an equally small town, the drama club wouldn&#39;t have missed much money from opening night if the town was that small.  I feel like the ending was rushed and left out a lot of potential from a really good roll.  I also thought this was going to have an on going theme involving dreams, but it turned out the main character dreamed in the beginning but wasn&#39;t mentioned again and that was surprising.  The set up and plot was good. The conversation was good and I liked how the conversations were layed out for the reader.  I got a good sense of intentions and mood from each character. Dreams would be SO IMPORTANT to the main character that it was odd to me that it wasn&#39;t a part of her life. Someone that really dreams like that  will definitely be talking about her dreams ALL the time. In fact, she&#39;s more likely to have a situation where she tells the dream, but since she&#39;s nit believed--- there&#39;s already a &quot;cry wolf&quot; issue with the MC and thst would&#39;ve fit into the dream obsessed person.  &quot;Oh sure it&#39;s just another of your dreams&quot;.<br>I did genuinely enjoy this book.  I have an alternative version in my mind, adding so much and stretching it out.  <br><br>The narration... was. So. Good.  The recording quality, the voices, bravo!  Definitely would listen to other books JUST for the narrator.  <br><br>The story was good even though it really didn&#39;t have anything at all to do with dreams or dreaming or Astral travel.  <br><br>If there&#39;s a way to tip this channel I absolutely will.  This was enjoyable and I appreciate it.  I only wish there was a lot more mystery, *dreaming*, plot and meat.',\n",

I&#39;m pretty sure this one will be as good and entertaining as the Coven&#39;s secret. And though I&#39;m a little hesitant to spill but will you be planning to write about Kara the supergirl and her courageous adventures to save the world from whoever meant to harm? If you will, I would love that because I&#39;ve loved this supergirl television series and all of Kara&#39;s super cool exciting adventures she went on with a view to protect the world from evil. So that&#39;s why I was wondering if you have any plans on working on this sort of story about the supergirl kara anytime in the future. :)',\n",

He is giving me higher expectations for my own relationship ahaha! I also hope Sophia become badass again, like she was in the first few books ;( missing her feistiness before the trauma.

I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself, my channel, and a little about how my audiobooks work on here.\\n\\nAll my audiobooks will be uploaded to my channel and organized into series playlists. As of recording this, my plan for new releases is to release on retailers first, and then to upload the audiobook to YouTube three months after its initial release.\\n\\nI will be uploading all of my books that are cowritten with Megan Linski to my channel. She has her own channel as well, where she'll be uploading her solo titles, including the University of Sorcery series, which is set in our Hidden Legends universe.\\n\\nAll my audiobooks on my channel are complete and free to listen to. Due to length restrictions, some of them have been split into two or three parts. And then for any explicitly sexy scenes we do cut or edit those to comply with community guidelines, but nothing else has been edited or removed.\\n\\nFor reading order, you can read my series in any order. I do have a recommended reading order for Hidden Legends. So that is a universe featuring four separate series with more to come. Megan and I suggest starting with Academy of Magical Creatures series, then head over to her channel for the University of Sorcery series, then come back here for College of Witchcraft, and finally Prison for Supernatural Offenders. The stories will still make sense if you read them out of that order, but if you're looking for a recommended reading order, that is what we suggest.\\n\\nFor more information about my books, you can visit me at aliciaradesauthor.com, or to learn more about Hidden Legends, you can find us at hiddenlegendsbooks.com. \\n\\nThank you so much for joining me, and I hope you enjoy the audiobooks!\",\n",

I’m in here because of her— the girl who claims to own half my soul.\\n\\nAfter losing my sight, I grew up as an orphan, banished from magical society. I learned enough on the streets to survive the gangs and fight clubs inside the prison. But nothing could prepare me for the Darke Games.\\n\\nAva-Marie is my worst enemy, but if we’re going to break out of here, we’ll have to get along. Yet the more I let Ava in, the more I want her. I can’t let my desire for her get in the way of my one chance at escape.\\n\\nExcept it already has.

Carter. Due to the length of this free audiobook, it has been uploaded in two parts. Listen to Part 2 here: https://youtu.be/wlq3TObh3nw\\n\\nBook Summary:\\n\\nAva-Marie: My name is Ava-Marie, and I love living on the dark side.\\nGetting into trouble is kind of my thing, but one night, I take revenge too far. I’m sentenced to a reform school for magical delinquents… though really, it’s a prison.\\n\\nAs the only supernatural who can control both fire and water, I’m already a target. To make matters worse, I literally share a soul with Charlie, a sexy inmate from the wrong side of the tracks. Surviving at the Institute is almost as risky as falling in love.\\n\\nBut there’s a way out. The Warden is offering a pardon for the team who wins the Darke Games— a sick, twisted competition where more prisoners come out dead than alive.\\n\\nThey think I’m the bad guy. I’m about to show them just how much of a villain I can be.\\n\\nCharlie: I shouldn’t be at the Institute. I’m in here because of her— the girl who claims to own half my soul.\\n\\nAfter losing my sight, I grew up as an orphan, banished from magical society. I learned enough on the streets to survive the gangs and fight clubs inside the prison. But nothing could prepare me for the Darke Games.\\n\\nAva-Marie is my worst enemy, but if we’re going to break out of here, we’ll have to get along. Yet the more I let Ava in, the more I want her. I can’t let my desire for her get in the way of my one chance at escape.\\n\\nExcept it already has. There’s a dark power inside of Ava that terrifies me…\\n\\nAnd none of us will be prepared when it unleashes.\\n\\n***\\n\\nContinue the series in book two, The Criminal Lair: https://youtu.be/K0lkxITvJ1M\\n\\nIf you'd like a copy to keep forever, you can find our audiobooks at all major audiobook retailers.

We’re prepared to face the Elders, but we can’t do it without the Azaimperiai. The ancient artifact will summon the ancestors to fight beside us. It’s our only hope at winning this war.\\n\\nBut first, we must find the Familiars the Elders stole— before they can slaughter them and kill our people. We’ve finally discovered the true meaning of the prophecy, but it’s nothing like we expected.\\n\\nThe prophecy says I’ll lose my life to save the tribe. Nothing could ever prepare me for leaving my daughter behind.\\n\\nLiam: At the end of the world, things have never looked better just as they’re falling apart.\\n\\nMy daughter gives me hope for the future, but there won’t be a future for her if the Elders continue to rule. To defeat them, we have to make a last stand. The fate of the Hawkei will be determined in the greatest battle of our time. If the rebellion falls, our people will be lost forever— as well as our magical creatures.\\n\\nYet the prophecy is clear. To prevent the Elementai from going extinct, a sacrifice must be made. Sophia and I have to choose between saving our tribe… or saving our family.\\n\\n**\\n\\nIf you'd like a copy to keep forever, you can find our audiobooks at all major audiobook retailers.

I failed my semester final and exposed the angels and demons to the human world. Luckily, the Alliance is giving me a chance to fix things. If I go on record stating it was all a hoax, I’ll be free to return to Harris Academy.\\n\\nBut I’m not sure I’ve made the right choice. War is mounting outside the academy.

Chanting it aligns the individual with the natural rhythms of the cosmos, fostering a sense of harmony and connection to the universe.\\n\\n😇 Meditative Power\\n‘Aum’ is often used as a mantra in meditation practices. Repeating this sacred sound helps calm the mind, reduce mental chatter, and usher the practitioner into a state of deep concentration and mindfulness. It symbolizes the journey from the external world to the inner self.\\n\\n⚖️ Balancing Energy Centers (Chakras)\\nIn yoga and Ayurveda, the seven energy centers or chakras are essential for overall well-being. Chanting ‘Aum’ is believed to activate and balance these chakras, especially the Agya Chakra (Third eye chakra), promoting physical, emotional, and spiritual equilibrium.\\n\\n💆🏻\\u200d♀️ Release of Tension\\nThe vibrations generated by chanting ‘Aum’ can release physical and mental tension stored in the body.

This is a superpower to have. \\n\\nAcross various traditions, religions, and even the scientific community, Yoga Nidra is recognised as a fundamental practice for mental, physical and spiritual growth. In Jainism, it's known as kayotsar, while the scientific world recognises it as Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR).\\n\\nI've personally experienced the transformative effects of Yoga Nidra, and I look forward to taking you through this session of deep relaxation and heightened awareness. \\n\\nFor those seeking spiritual growth, practice this Yoga Nidra daily for the next 42 days right before sleeping. You will uncover a new possibility within yourself. 🙂\",\n",

       "  'video_description': \"Important :  If you have an any physical ailments, injuries or have had surgery in the last 6 months, please consult your physician before practising any kind of physical exercise including Yogasanas. \\n\\nWe invite you this simple flow which has 3 parts : 20 minutes of asanas for physical health, 7 minutes of Yog Nidra for deep rest and 7 minutes of pranayama for mental and emotional health. \\n\\nThis is a complete practice for overall health that you can practice every day!\\n\\nThings to Remember \\n1. Always practice on an empty stomach. Keep a gap of at least 3 hours between your meal and your practice. If you've eaten fruits, a gap of 2 hours would be sufficient. \\n2. Wear loose comfortable cotton clothes. Please DO NOT wear tight, polyester, dry fit clothes while practising asanas. You skin requires fresh air during asanas. \\n3. If you're a complete beginner, it would be wise to keep a mirror next to you while you practice. This will allow you to observe your posture and help you auto-correct. \\n\\nStay connected on Instagram for daily yoga knowledge - https://www.instagram.com/satvic.yoga/\\n\\nFor food and lifestyle guidance follow our channel - @SatvicMovement  \\n\\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nDisclaimer: Satvic Yoga recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any exercise program.

It is definitely not an easy journey but it is absolutely worth it 🚃\\n\\nOur top 3 ways to do the work are listed below:\\n\\n1. Engage in self-care: Taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually can help you feel better overall. Make sure to eat well, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and engage in activities that bring you joy. You could also engage in activities that take you into a flow state like painting, dancing, gardening etc. 🛁\\n\\n2. Practice forgiveness: Forgiving yourself or others can be a liberating experience. It does not mean you condone what happened, but it means you are willing to let go of the negative emotions associated with it 🤗\\n\\n3. Practicing Yoga: Personally, yoga has impacted my life in a big way and I was able to let go of many unresolved emotions just by coming on my mat and today I love to spread this knowledge with others 🕉️',\n",

       "  'video_description': \"https://yogachallenge.in/syt\\nLearn asanas, pranayama and yoga philosophy step by step with us in LIVE sessions!\\n\\nWelcome to our Yoga for Anxiety Relief video. In this session, we'll guide you through a soothing series of poses designed to help you release tension, quiet your mind, and alleviate anxiety. This practice is more than just physical; it's a holistic approach that combines deep breathing, mindful movements, and the power of presence to help you find inner peace.\\n\\nRemember, yoga is not about perfection, it's about progress and personal growth. So, don't worry if you can't perform every pose perfectly. Listen to your body, move at your own pace, and most importantly, be gentle with yourself.\\n\\nHere are a few tips to enhance your practice:\\nPractice on an empty stomach. Ensure a gap of at least 3 hours between your meal and practice. If you've had a fruit, a 2-hour gap is sufficient.\\nWear loose, comfortable cotton clothes. Avoid tight, polyester, dry-fit clothing as your skin needs fresh air as you transition between asanas.\\nIf you're a beginner, consider keeping a mirror next to you. This will help you observe and correct your poses.\\n\\nHappy Practising🥳\\n\\nStay connected with us on Instagram for daily yoga knowledge - https://www.instagram.com/satvic.yoga/\\n\\nFor more yoga videos and wellness tips, subscribe to our channel and hit the notification bell to never miss an update!\\n\\nFor food and lifestyle related guidance subscribe to our channel @SatvicMovement\\n_______________________________________________________________________\\nDisclaimer: Satvic Movement recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any exercise program.

       "  'video_description': \"To learn Yoga philosophy and practice asanas & pranayama with us, join us for the upcoming 21 Day Yoga Challenge - https://yogachallenge.in/cbp\\n\\nIn this 21 Day Yoga Program, you can attend LIVE classes every morning with us, go deeper into your yoga practice and also learn and practice healthy lifestyle & food habits. \\n\\nChandra Bhedana Pranayama, also known as the Moon Piercing Breath, is a powerful yet simple practice that harnesses the energy of the lunar (cooling) side of your breath. By focusing on inhaling & exhaling through the left nostril, we create a cooling effect within the body and activate the calming qualities of the parasympathetic nervous system.\\n\\nThis 10-minute practice offers a host of benefits that can enhance your overall well-being. When practiced regularly, Chandra Bhedana Pranayama can help you:\\n\\nCool down and balance your body: This breathing technique has a cooling effect on the body, making it an excellent practice during hot weather or when you feel overheated. It helps regulate body temperature and creates a sense of internal balance.\\n\\nCalm and relax the mind: By activating the parasympathetic nervous system, Chandra Bhedana Pranayama induces a state of relaxation and calmness. It can help reduce anxiety, stress, and restlessness, allowing you to experience a peaceful and tranquil state of mind.\\n\\nImprove focus and mental clarity: The practice of Chandra Bhedana Pranayama enhances mental clarity and sharpness. By promoting a calm mind, it can improve your ability to concentrate, make decisions, and stay present in the moment.\\n\\nHarmonize energy flow: This pranayama technique helps balance the ida nadi, the lunar energy channel, which is associated with the cooling, receptive, and introspective aspects of our being. By harmonizing the flow of energy, it supports overall vitality and well-being.\\n\\nThings to Remember while you practice asanas - \\n\\n1. Always practice on an empty stomach. Keep a gap of at least 3 hours between your meal and your practice. If you've eaten fruits, a gap of 2 hours would be sufficient. \\n2. Wear loose comfortable cotton clothes. Please DO NOT wear tight, polyester, dry fit clothes while practising asanas. You skin requires fresh air during asanas. \\n3. If you're a complete beginner, it would be wise to keep a mirror next to you while you practice. This will allow you to observe your posture and help you auto-correct. \\n4. Do not practice if you are pregnant or if you have had any type of surgery in the past 12 months. Also, do not practice if you have back or neck related issues. \\n\\nStay connected with us on Instagram for daily yoga knowledge - https://www.instagram.com/satvic.yoga/\\n\\nFor food and lifestyle related guidance subscribe to our channel @SatvicMovement \\n\\n____________________________________________________________\\n\\nDisclaimer: Satvic Movement recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any exercise program.

Throughout my treatment, I kept practising and it transformed my life. Today at 37, I'm the fittest I have ever been. I'm also calmer, more joyful and have beautiful relationships. This camp is an offering to all those who cannot step out of the home to practice yoga or don't get enough time to take care of themselves. Through these short and easy to follow videos, I hope you begin to care for yourself, improve your health and smile more often. \\n\\nLots of love, Radhika\",\n",

Yoga is not just asanas, it is not just a physical practice. Through this camp you will learn that yoga is as much about the mind and emotions as it is about the body. \\n\\nYou can clean your body, mind and emotions over these 21 days with the free guidance, love and support offered through these videos. The first week is centred around asanas for different body parts such as back, legs and abs. The second week will allow you to explore more restorative and stress relief classes. Lastly, the 3rd week will teach you many different simple vinyasa flows. \\n\\nEach class will be dynamic, vibrant and full of surprises. The language will be simple and instructions crystal clear so you get into asanas correctly.  Through these videos, you can improve your flexibility, strength, and balance. Each day, we will offer a new yoga practice that will challenge you in different ways and help you progress in your yoga journey.\\n\\nThe practice of yoga helps calm the mind, releases tension from the body, and promotes a sense of inner peace. If you're a working professional or a student, these practices can improve your focus and concentration and help you come up with creative ideas! \\n\\nAfter having taught over 100,000 people in our workshops, we know your needs! This camp comes from years of experience and personal Sadhana and it has the energy of your teacher.

There’s this very famous map of consciousness which was given by a internationally renowned spiritual teacher, psychiatrist, David R Hawkins and if you look at this - it shows the different states of being that are tehre and it corresponds different emotions to each state and you can see that all of these emotions are in the lower vibe area such as fear guilt and anger and as we go higher we have joy, peace, and enlightenment\\n\\nTime stamps \\n00:00 Intro\\n00:19 What are low vibe behaviours?\\n01:10 Low vibe behaviour #1 \\n02:14 Low vibe behaviour #2 \\n03:03 Low vibe behaviour #3 \\n04:13 Low vibe behaviour #4 \\n05:41 Low vibe behaviour #5 \\n06:40 Low vibe behaviour #6 \\n07:59 Low vibe behaviour #7 \\n09:41 Low vibe behaviour #8 \\n10:59 What to do next      \\n\\nThank you for watching 💕\\n\\n✨ LET'S CONNECT\\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/AdeteDahiya\\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/adetedahiya\\nNewsletter - https://bit.ly/3jmyq0a\\nE-mail | adete@adetedahiya.com\\n\\n✨ MUSIC\\nEpidemic Sound\",\n",

As a result, every moisturiser or night cream I tried fell flat on its face. Even with the kumkumadi oil, I was so skeptical. But it didn’t aggravate the condition the first time I applied it and so I decided to try it out for a month! And I don’t know what I was expecting in that month, but I can tell you that I saw my pigmentation and acne scars reduce and my skin no longer had those dry patches.\\nIt’s an Ayurvedic formulation made from the purest Kashmiri saffron the actually addresses modern skincare concerns very well. The kesar in the formula also means it has a very strong kesar colour. So one thing I always do when I include kumkumadi in my routine is I get a separate pillow cover to sleep on so that I don’t have saffron patches on my bedsheets :)\\n\\nPS: This is only meant to be used at night. So keep this in mind if you’re planning to try it, which you definitely should because it can really really work wonders for your skin.\",\n",

And  a lot of our actions determine whether we have it or not. So if you don't think you're special or you don't feel like you deserve the nice things every day, you're not going to be able to get them into your life. \\n\\nHere are the chapters for easier navigation:\\n00:00 Answer these questions \\n00:35 How I started using my nicest things \\n01:51 Special occasions are special only if you make them\\n02:19 The mindsets behind it\\n02:41 Start acting like the main character\\n03:07 Story behind my rings\\n04:26 The bag I've used every day for 2 years\\n05:48 The polaroid diaries\\n06:25 Humans are funny\\n07:00 What happens when you start using your nicest things every day \\n08:30 My coffee mug \\n09:45 Items are not just items\\n\\n\\n✨ LET'S CONNECT\\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/AdeteDahiya\\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/adetedahiya\\nNewsletter - https://bit.ly/3jmyq0a\\nE-mail | adete@adetedahiya.com\\n\\n✨ MUSIC\\nEpidemic Sound\",\n",

I considered how I deal with these situations and I am sharing my thoughts on the same in hopes that my experience and learnings will be helpful to some of you. \\n\\nI've discovered that when we question our value by others, we are actually questioning our self-worth and dealing with a reduced sense of self-esteem. And this is normal -\\xa0it happens to all of us from time to time. But when others' opinions start to hold bigger value in our lives than our own, it becomes problematic. \\n\\nAn important factor I've emphasised in the video is how improving your own value in your eyes can help deal with this issue. It can help you become stronger mentally and rely less on what others think of you. And it all boils down to practising this daily. \\n\\nSo here are the timestamps for easier navigation: \\n00:00 Intro & question\\n00:48 Why do others' opinion matters?\\n01:21 Self-valuation exercise.

And this means you can get more done. The problem is that to be good at time management, you need to develop 3 core skills: Awareness, Arrangement, and Adaptation. \\nBut most mainstream productivity advice just caters to your arrangement skills —\\xa0whether it is creating a schedule, using the Pomodoro method, making to-do lists, or doing your biggest task first — all of these only tell you how to optimize and organize your plans & workflow. And they don’t pay enough attention to having realistic timeframes and adapting to changing situations, which is why most productivity hacks you try fall flat on their face.\\n\\nIn this video, I share 3 techniques that have worked for me.

Here’s the writeup for ease of understanding and reading:\\n\\nChange is visible in little shifts\\nBeing just a little happier, a little calmer, a little more at ease than you used be. \\nIt’s in the habits you’re building \\nIn the choices you make \\nIt’s in how your mindset is evolving\\nIn how you’ve become more resilient, more focused on growth, and less bothered by criticism\\nIt’s in how you’re learning to accept yourself\\nTo respect your body, to nurture your mind, to be more confident in your own skin\\nIt’s in how you’re learning to trust your journey\\nTo be more patient with yourself and those around you. To be more focused on action than on the results\\nIt’s in the way you are developing empathy\\nBeing kinder to those around you and being more accepting of differences \\nIt’s in the way you’re realizing what you want \\nAnd not being influenced by every shiny new thing you see\\nIt’s in the way that you’re learning to forgive and let go \\nAnd not holding on to things and people that have hurt you in the past. \\nIt’s how you start to respect boundaries\\nand enforce your own without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. \\nIt’s in finding your own definition of success\\nIn learning that you don’t want to be the next Elon musk or Zendaya and that’s okay\\nChange is in learning to accept your flaws \\nAnd working on them to become a better version of yourself for yourself\\nIt’s in being more content in the present \\nAnd not spending all your energy living in the past or dreaming about the future. \\nIt’s in actively working on healing yourself\\nAnd not tormenting yourself waiting for closure\\nIt’s in feeling gratitude for where you are in life\\nWhile simultaneously focusing on your growth. \\nIt’s in understanding that you don’t have to conform in order to be happy\\nAnd that your definition of change and growth is unique to you. \\nChange is in how you go about the everyday.\\n\\nLove \\nAdete\\n\\n✨ LET'S CONNECT\\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/AdeteDahiya\\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/adetedahiya\\nE-mail | adete@adetedahiya.com\\n\\n\\n✨ MUSIC\\nEpidemic Sound\",\n",

Yes we don’t have control over everything and yes things will go off the rails every now and then, but building these practices has helped me stay calmer and collected when shit does hit the fan.\\n\\nTo give you an example, I had a very different video planned for you guys this week. But there was a crisis at work and I had to travel the last min to Bombay, and that couldn’t be executed. Now I could’ve made things complicated by either whining about not being able to make that video and then not sharing anything with you this week. Or I could have exhausted myself trying to bring that video to life. And that would’ve made things complicated. But we didn’t, we try to learn from our past mistakes & make things easier & find more balance.

Your productivity is a result of three things or rather managing three things - your attention, your time, and your energy. So if you’re lacking in either of these, you can effectively procrastinate and while away time\\n\\nFor instance, if you don’t manage your attention, your procrastination will look like spending attention on anything that’s shinier than the work at hand. If you don’t manage your time, you will procrastinate by spending it on anything but the task at hand. And if you don’t manage your energy, you will procrastinate by typically doing anything else that requires little to no energy.\\n\\nIn this video, I share a few different habits that help me tackle all three of these things and thereby avoid procrastination on most days. \\n\\nHere are the timestamps: \\n00:00 Intro\\n00:22 Why we procrastinate?\\n00:53 Habit 1\\n01:39 Habit 2\\n02:16 Habit 3\\n03:25 Habit 4\\n04:19 Habit 5\\n05:22 Habit 6\\n06:16 Habit 7\\n07:00 One thing to keep in mind\\n\\n\\nThank you for watching 💕\\n\\n✨ LET'S CONNECT\\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/adetedahiya\\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/AdeteDahiya\\nNewsletter - https://bit.ly/3jmyq0a\\nE-mail | adete@adetedahiya.com\\n\\n✨ MUSIC\\nEpidemic Sound\",\n",

But here’s where the difference lies –\\xa0frugality is about being intentional with how you spend your money while being cheap is just about the act of preventing spending anywhere and everywhere it’s possible. \\n\\nThe problem with being cheap is that you might think like you’re saving money right now but it can end up costing you a lot more in the future. And there’s a misconception that if you’re spending more upfront or on a high-end product that you cannot save. In reality, if you invest in something that is going to last you years, has a lifetime warranty or could save you money over time, you’re being more intentional with your money. \\n\\nResearch mentioned in the video\\n\\n- https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/79-milk-in-state-is-adulterated-study/article30976549 \\n- https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-announces-results-second-sunscreen-absorption-study \\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYTIh2cXfvM&t=84s \\n- https://www.elle.com/uk/beauty/skin/a26957334/hormone-disruptors-skincare/ \\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4086778/ \\n\\nChoosing the right health insurance\\n- https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/health-insurance-guide/ \\n- https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/a-guide-to-choosing-the-right-health-insurance-policy-11599735568246.html \\n\\nThank you for watching 💕\\n\\n✨ LET'S CONNECT\\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/AdeteDahiya\\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/adetedahiya\\nNewsletter - https://bit.ly/3jmyq0a\\nE-mail | adete@adetedahiya.com\\n\\n✨ ABOUT ME\\nHi!
